# frontend feature notes
- search bar: applied to text fields, i.e., all fields other than date
- filter: if multiple filters are applied, it checks if the row satisfies all conditions. e.g., if selected country is USA and selected type is “news” but the row’s type does not contain “news”, it won’t be displayed.
