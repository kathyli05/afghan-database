It reveals that air pollution in Afghanistan led to 37,033 deaths in 2019, contributing significantly to mortality rates. The study also highlights the impact of air pollution on various health measures, especially lower respiratory infections, neonatal disorders, ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and diabetes mellitus. Comparison of data between 1990 and 2019 shows air pollution as a consistent prominent risk factor in contributing to deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and years of life lost (YLLs). Afghanistan's burden of disease due to air pollution is shown to be substantial, on par with other high-burden nations like China, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. The study underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions to address the significant public health threat posed by air pollution in Afghanistan.","The topics extracted from the article content are:

They found that the occurrence of extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) was significantly associated with patients' geographical origins. Patients from regions such as South-East Asia, Africa, and the Eastern Mediterranean were more likely to have isolated EPTB. Similarly, specific countries like India, Pakistan, and Somalia showed a higher association with EPTB occurrence. The study suggests that geographical origin can be a predictor for different clinical forms of TB, possibly due to delays in diagnosis, impairments in the immune system, virulence factors of the bacterium, and comorbidities. The study highlights the importance of considering geographical origin in the management of TB patients.","The topics extracted from the article content are:

This article explores the trajectory and correlates of social isolation for veterans during a 6-month period amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The study involved 188 U.S. veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and found that social isolation slightly decreased and stabilized over time. Higher levels of social isolation were associated with lower emotional support, mental health, relationship quality, and couple satisfaction. The study highlights the importance of understanding social isolation in veterans and its impacts on mental health and social functioning.Prospective analyses did not show significant within-person effects of social isolation on outcomes, but person-mean isolation was a predictor of worse outcomes.limitations include a lack of pre-COVID data, brief assessment measures, and retrospectively rated data.

The process of proving trauma, quantifying sacrifice, and authenticating trauma impacted veterans' personal and collective identities. The study revealed misunderstandings in disability rating meanings between veterans and providers, as veterans viewed compensation as validation of their sacrifices while providers saw it as potentially counter-therapeutic. The bureaucratic processes of diagnosis, treatment, and claims contributed to systemic and individual-level stigma experiences for the veterans. The study emphasized the need for institutions to understand how their processes impact individuals and the unintended consequences of bureaucratic procedures on mental health and stigma.","The topics extracted from the article content are:

Drug resistant tuberculosis in Afghanistan: We must continue to put people at the centre of treatment,Mesic A.,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.o46,2022-01-10,[],Note,1,Yes,"The article discusses the challenges of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in Afghanistan, particularly affecting women and children. The author emphasizes the importance of putting people at the center of treatment to improve outcomes.

The introduction of shorter oral regimens and community-based follow-ups has improved the patient experience. However, recent political changes and decreased funding from major donors have created additional obstacles. The author calls for continued support and humanitarian assistance to address the broader healthcare needs in Afghanistan, alongside TB treatment.","[Health, Humanitarian]"

It assessed three key national-level facilitators: the presence of SPC antihypertensives on national Essential Medicines Lists (EMLs), recommendations for SPC use in national hypertension guidelines, and the availability of SPCs on the market. The findings revealed that 11 countries had all facilitators in place, with SPC antihypertensives already included on their EMLs and guidelines. The study highlighted the importance of national policy support, alignment with international guidelines, and market availability of SPCs to facilitate the uptake of SPC antihypertensives in LMICs.","The topics extracted from the article content are:

The research surveyed 1,730 veterans, of which 60% provided a DNA sample. The genetic risk variants investigated were associated with PTSD and substance misuse. The study found that a history of depression, PTSD genetic risk score, childhood abuse/neglect, and lifetime marijuana use were significant predictors of attempting suicide or having a suicide plan. Conversely, rural residence was found to be protective against suicide risk. The study also examined the association between genetic risk factors and suicidal behaviors among veterans and highlighted the importance of understanding and addressing these risk factors in veterans' mental health care.","The topics extracted from the article are:

Mapping and population size estimates of people who inject drugs in Afghanistan in 2019: Synthesis of multiple methods,Rasheed A.,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262405,2022-01-01,['Health and Social Development Organization'],Article,1,Yes,"Summary:
The study aimed to estimate the number of people who inject drugs (PWID) in Afghanistan in 2019 by using multiple methods including key informant interviews, unique object and service multipliers, capture-recapture, wisdom of the crowds, and an Anchored Multiplier Bayesian approach for data synthesis. The study identified 374 hotspots in eight cities in Afghanistan and estimated the total number of PWID in the country to be 57,207 (0.37% of the adult population age 15-64 years). The study provided essential information for planning interventions to address the vulnerable at-risk PWID population in Afghanistan.","The topics extracted from the article content are:

Research has come to a standstill, funds have dried up, and many scientists are struggling to leave the country to continue their careers. The Taliban's restrictions on academic freedoms and the fear of persecution have created a desperate situation for researchers, causing many to consider leaving the country. International funding for research projects has been put on hold, public universities are barely functioning, and private universities are struggling with financial issues. The situation has led to a brain drain in Afghanistan as researchers seek refuge abroad, facing challenges in securing positions and leaving the country due to closed embassies. The outlook for improvement in the near future is bleak, as researchers continue to face obstacles in continuing their work.","[Research, Funding, Academics]"
