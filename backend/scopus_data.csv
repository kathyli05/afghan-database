Effect of an educational intervention based on health belief model on preventive behaviors against malaria in over 18-year-old Afghan immigrants living in Parsian,"Zhila Pasalari, Roghayeh ezati rad, Zahra Hosseini, Habibolah Torki, Amin Ghanbarnejad, Teamur Aghamolaei",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-024-10016-9,2024-10-3,['Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Education']","['Disease Prevention', 'Literacy Programs']",,"**Summary of the Article:**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The study focuses on Afghan immigrants residing in Parsian city, highlighting the social context of migration and the health challenges faced by immigrant populations, particularly relating to diseases such as malaria, which is prevalent in certain regions and affected by factors like living conditions and access to health education.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) in promoting malaria preventive behaviors among Afghan immigrants over the age of 18. It addresses the human rights challenge of ensuring health education and prevention measures for vulnerable populations, such as immigrants, who might lack access to regular healthcare services.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study utilized an educational intervention incorporating face-to-face training sessions, lectures, group discussions, and distribution of pamphlets to increase awareness and change behaviors. It employed the HBM constructs, including perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy, to structure the intervention and measure changes in malaria preventive behaviors before and after the intervention.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The intervention resulted in a significant improvement in the participants' scores across all HBM constructs, leading to increased adoption of malaria preventive behaviors. Participants reported higher perceived susceptibility and severity of malaria, greater perceived benefits of taking preventive actions, and reduced barriers to engaging in these behaviors. The intervention effectively increased awareness and changed behaviors, leading to better malaria prevention.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   The article did not specifically examine the country’s legal frameworks or policies related to human rights. The focus was more on direct health education strategies rather than systemic legal or policy analysis.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors concluded that the HBM-based educational intervention had a positive impact on the prevention of malaria among the study population. They recommended ongoing educational efforts to sustain the behavior change and suggested involving participants throughout intervention stages to enhance engagement and effectiveness. They highlighted the importance of tailored health education programs for immigrant communities to address health disparities.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The study faced several limitations including participant absences due to work or lack of interest, variations in literacy levels that could affect understanding and engagement, and potential selection bias from the random sampling method. Differences in the literacy levels and large numbers of questionnaire items also posed challenges. Care was taken to manage contamination bias by selecting geographically separated intervention and control groups. The study protocol was strictly followed to mitigate these issues.","Abstract
                Background
                Malaria disease is one of the most dangerous protozoan parasitic infections with a high mortality rate in developing countries. Malaria is a public health issue, especially in Hormozgan province, and is highly affected by foreign immigrants (Pakistani and Afghani); thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of an intervention based on the health belief model (HBM) on the promotion of malaria prevention behaviors in Afghani immigrants over the age of 18. The participants resided in Persian city in Hormozgan province.
              
                Methods
                The present quasi-experimental study was conducted on 200 Afghans immigrants over 18 years of age who visited four comprehensive health service centers in Parsian city, south of Iran in June until December 2023. Sampling was by cluster method. In this way, the health centers were considered as clusters, and then 4 centers were randomly selected from among them (two centers of the control group and two centers of the intervention group) and participants were selected by a systematic random method by list of records in the National Integrated Health Record System (called SIB) (100participants control group, 100 participants intervention group). The data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire based on the HBM before and after the educational intervention An educational program was designed and implemented to promote preventive behaviors against malaria in five sessions using different strategies and based on the HBM for the intervention group. The data were analyzed using independent-samples T-test, paired-samples T-test, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, analysis of covariance and linear regression. All statistical analyses and hypothesis testing were done in IBM SPSS version 25, at a significance level of 0.05.
              
                Results
                In the intervention group, there was a significant difference in the mean scores of knowledge (6.48, 95% CI: 5.9,7.05), perceived susceptibility (10.57, 95% CI: 10.03, 11.1), perceived severity (16.61, 95% CI: 15.83, 16.83), perceived self-efficacy (18.26, 95% CI: 17.55, 18.96), perceived benefits (15.43, 95% CI: 14.68, 16.17), perceived barriers (-22.49, 95% CI: -23.63, -21.30), cues to action (15.06, 95% CI: 14.36, 15.75), and preventive behaviors (20.05, 95% CI: 19.44, 20.65), before and after the educational intervention. P-value &lt; 0.001. The regression analysis showed that the constructs of perceived susceptibility (T = 4.72, P &lt; 0.001), cues to action (T = 5.30, P &lt; 0.001)and perceived self-efficacy (T = 4.93, P &lt; 0.001) led to the greatest change in malaria prevention behaviors(R-Square = 0.549).
              
                Conclusion
                The present findings showed that the HBM -based intervention was effective in preventive behaviors against malaria in Afghans. It is recommended to design suitable educational interventions in order to increase the perceived susceptibility, cues to action and self-efficacy in order to improve preventive behaviors against malaria in Afghans.

                Background
                One of the most significant events in recent Afghan history is the rise of the Taliban and the war that followed, which had profound impacts on the lives of Afghans. The present study examined the mental health of Afghans living under the Taliban government.
              
                Methods
                Between June 5, 2023 and February 12, 2024, a cross-sectional study was conducted among the Afghan population in three key regions of Afghanistan. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. The 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress scale (DASS-21) was utilized to assess depression, anxiety and stress of the Afghan population. Ethical permission for this study was granted by the Afghanistan Center for Epidemiological Studies (ACES). Logistic regression models were employed to explore the relationship between socio-demographic characteristics and depression, anxiety, and stress among 2,698 participants.
              
                Results
                The prevalence of depression was 72.05%, anxiety was 71.94%, and stress was 66.49%. Multiple regression analysis indicated that gender (being female), economic status (being poor), residency (living in rural areas), education level (being illiterate), being a cigarette smoker, and having experienced a bad event during the past month were significantly associated with depression, anxiety and stress.
              
                Conclusion
                The findings of the present study show very high levels of anxiety, depression, and stress, most likely reflecting the profound impact of recent political, social, and economic changes. Notably, a significant majority of participants, particularly females and individuals above 35 years of age, reported severe to extremely severe mental health symptoms. The mental health crisis in Afghanistan is a complex and urgent issue that requires a comprehensive and compassionate response.

                Background
                In response to the global scope of forced displacement, international organizations highlight the need of scalable solutions to support individuals’ health and integration into host societies. Exposure to high mental and physical stress perceived before, during, and after displacement can impair functional capabilities, essential for adapting to a new environment. This secondary analysis examined the impact of an exercise and sport intervention on cognitive function and pain severity among individuals living in a refugee camp in Greece.
              
                Methods
                We implemented a randomized controlled trial involving n = 142 (52.8% women) forcibly displaced individuals from Southwest Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Participants were randomly assigned to a waitlist or a 10-week co-designed exercise and sport intervention with a 1:1 allocation rate between groups and sexes. Assessments at baseline and follow-up included the Flanker task, the Oddball paradigm, pain severity via visual analog scales, and the Åstrand-Rhyming indirect test of maximal oxygen uptake. We analyzed the intervention effects using structural equation modeling.
              
                Results
                Our findings did not indicate a direct intervention effect on cognitive function or pain (p ≥ .332). However, the intervention group significantly improved cardiorespiratory fitness, ß = .17, p = .010, which was associated with faster reaction times in cognitive tasks, ß =  − .22, p = .004. Moreover, there was some evidence that adherence might be linked to reduced pain severity, ß =  − .14, p = .065.
              
                Conclusions
                Exercise and sport did not directly impact cognitive function and pain severity among a sociodemographically diverse sample living in a refugee camp, suggesting the need for complementary measures. Nevertheless, our results indicate that improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness benefit aspects of attention.

Context Overview:**
The study focuses on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, examining trends in lower extremity amputations (LEAs) from 1990 to 2019. This area often experiences socio-political instability, conflict, and natural disasters, impacting healthcare infrastructure and access. These events, alongside rising rates of conditions like diabetes mellitus (DM) and peripheral vascular diseases, contribute to fluctuating LEA rates.

**2. Purpose of Research:**
The research aims to investigate the temporal trends and burden of LEAs in the MENA region using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) dataset. It addresses the human rights challenges linked to healthcare access disparities and the impact of socio-political events on health outcomes.

**3. Research Methods:**
The researchers utilized the GBD dataset, analyzing data from 1990 to 2019. This method allowed them to assess trends in LEA and toe amputation rates across numerous countries within the MENA region.

**4. Main Findings:**
LEA trends varied significantly across the region. In countries like Syria, Yemen, and Afghanistan, LEA rates increased significantly, correlating with socio-political instability and conflict. Conversely, nations such as Iraq, Palestine, and Kuwait saw declines. Factors contributing to these trends include wars, natural disasters, and chronic health conditions like DM. Increased amputations in countries during conflict illustrate how regional turmoil affects health outcomes.

**5. Legal Frameworks and Institutions:**
The study did not directly examine the legal frameworks, but it highlights how healthcare access, influenced by political and socioeconomic factors, impacts human rights through disparities in health outcomes.

**6. Conclusions and Recommendations:**
The authors conclude that the MENA region needs targeted public health interventions. For countries with conflict-driven LEA increases, integrating healthcare with disaster response is crucial. For regions battling DM and vascular diseases, enhanced chronic disease management is recommended. Recommendations include improving access to preventive care and addressing healthcare access disparities, such as income and insurance, to manage LEA rates effectively.

**7. Limitations:**
The study's limitations stem from a lack of localized data and potential biases in the GBD dataset. Variations in data collection systems within the MENA region result in disparities in data quality, particularly affecting remote and rural areas. This restricts the understanding of intra-country variations, potentially leading to inaccuracies in reporting the LEA burden.",No abstract available

                Background
                Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for a substantial number of deaths in Afghanistan. Understanding the prevalence and correlates of major NCD risk factors could provide a benchmark for future public health policies and programs to prevent and control NCDs. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the prevalence and correlates of NCD risk factors among adults aged 18–69 years in Afghanistan.
              
                Methods
                We used data from the Afghanistan STEPS Survey 2018. The study population were 3650 (1896 males and 1754 females) adults aged 18–69 years sampled from all 34 provinces through a multistage cluster sampling process. Information on behavioural and biological risk factors was collected. We used STATA (version 18.0) for data analysis.
              
                Results
                Of the total participants, 42.8% were overweight or obese, 8.6% were current smokers, 26.9% had insufficient physical activities, 82.6% had low consumption of fruits and vegetables, and only 0.5% had ever consumed alcohol. Approximately 15% of participants had a high salt intake, while 25% and 8% had elevated blood pressure and blood glucose levels, respectively. Similarly, around 18% had elevated total cholesterol. The study revealed a lower prevalence of current smoking among females [AOR = 0.17, 95%CI (0.09–0.30)] compared with males, but a higher prevalence in those who had higher education levels [1.95 (1.13–3.36)] compared with those with no formal education. Insufficient physical activity was higher in participants aged 45–69 years [1.96 (1.39–2.76)], females [4.21 (1.98–8.84)], and urban residents [2.38 (1.46–3.88)] but lower in those with higher education levels [0.60 (0.37–0.95)]. Participants in the 25th to 75th wealth percentiles had higher odds of low fruit and vegetable consumption [2.11 (1.39–3.21)], while those in the &gt; 75th wealth percentile had lower odds of high salt intake [0.63 (0.41–0.98)]. Being overweight/obese was more prevalent in participants aged 45–69 years [1.47 (1.03–2.11)], females [1.42 (0.99–2.01)], currently married [3.56 (2.42–5.21)] or ever married [5.28 (2.76–10.11)], and urban residents [1.39 (1.04–1.86)]. Similarly, high waist circumference was more prevalent in participants aged 45–69 years [1.86 (1.21–2.86)], females [5.91 (4.36–8.00)], those being currently married [4.82 (3.12–7.46)], and those being in 25th to 75th wealth percentile [1.76 (1.27–2.43)]. A high prevalence of elevated blood pressure was observed in participants aged 45–69 years [3.60 (2.44–5.31)] and currently married [2.31 (1.24–4.31)] or ever married [6.13 (2.71–13.8)] participants. Elevated blood glucose was more prevalent in older adults ([1.92 (1.09–3.39)] for 45–69 and [3.45 (2.44–5.31)] for 30–44 years), urban residents [2.01 (1.33–3.03)], and ever-married participants [4.89 (1.48–16.2)]. A higher prevalence of elevated cholesterol was observed in females [2.68 (1.49–4.82)] and those currently married [2.57 (1.17–5.63)] or ever married [4.24 (1.31–13.73)].

"Antibiotic consumption in hospitals in humanitarian settings in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and South Sudan","Kristina Skender, Gabriel Versace, Annick Danyele Lenglet, Kate Clezy",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-024-01449-7,2024-8-15,"['Karolinska Institutet', 'Medecins Sans Frontieres']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Disease Prevention', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Health Services in Humanitarian Settings']",,"Here's a summary of the article based on your outlined points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The study was conducted in six MSF-supported hospitals in humanitarian settings, highlighting challenges in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) grappling with high antibiotic consumption, potentially influenced by factors such as regional insecurity, conflict, and inconsistent healthcare supply chains.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions**: The research aimed to document antibiotic consumption across hospitals in humanitarian settings, addressing potential human rights challenges around healthcare accessibility and the responsible use of antibiotics in environments with constrained resources.

3. **Research Methods**: Antibiotic consumption data were collected from six hospitals between 2018 and 2020. Defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1,000 bed-days were used to measure antibiotic usage. The study compared these findings to consumption rates in other hospitals worldwide, particularly emphasizing variations based on local contexts.

4. **Main Findings**: Antibiotic consumption was significantly higher in the MSF-supported hospitals compared to global averages, with variations attributed to patient case-mix and local healthcare infrastructure. The majority of antibiotics used were from the WHO 'Access' category, though some hospitals fell slightly below the WHO guidelines. A notable reduction in overall antibiotic use, particularly in Boost hospital, was observed during the study period.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The study noted that while most countries had developed national action plans on antimicrobial resistance, there was limited commitment to implementing these plans, impacting antibiotic use trends.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors concluded that high antibiotic consumption in these settings poses challenges to antimicrobial stewardship. They recommend more detailed data collection, including diagnostics and case-mix adjustments, to improve antibiotic prescribing practices. Continued monitoring and the introduction of stewardship programs are essential to ensure responsible antibiotic use.

7. **Study Limitations**: Limitations included inconsistent data from at least one study location, the inability to compare data across hospitals with different contexts reliably, and the lack of detailed patient-level data to assess prescribing appropriateness. Regional instability and lack of diagnostic capacity further complicated the findings. Additionally, the political climate and healthcare infrastructure variability hindered understanding the broader implications of consumption patterns.","Abstract
                Background
                Antimicrobial resistance is of great global public health concern. In order to address the paucity of antibiotic consumption data and antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems in hospitals in humanitarian settings, we estimated antibiotic consumption in six hospitals with the aim of developing recommendations for improvements in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
              
                Methods
                Six hospitals supported by Médecins sans Frontières were included in the study: Boost-Afghanistan, Kutupalong-Bangladesh, Baraka and Mweso-Democratic Republic of Congo, Kule-Ethiopia, and Bentiu-South Sudan. Data for 36,984 inpatients and antibiotic consumption data were collected from 2018 to 2020. Antibiotics were categorized per World Health Organization Access Watch Reserve classification. Total antibiotic consumption was measured by Defined Daily Doses (DDDs)/1000 bed-days.
              
                Results
                Average antibiotic consumption in all hospitals was 2745 DDDs/1000 bed-days. Boost hospital had the highest antibiotic consumption (4157 DDDs/1000 bed-days) and Bentiu the lowest (1598 DDDs/1000 bed-days). In all hospitals, Access antibiotics were mostly used (69.7%), followed by Watch antibiotics (30.1%). The most consumed antibiotics were amoxicillin (23.5%), amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (14%), and metronidazole (13.2%). Across all projects, mean annual antibiotic consumption reduced by 22.3% during the study period, mainly driven by the reduction in Boost hospital in Afghanistan.
              
                Conclusions
                This was the first study to assess antibiotic consumption by DDD metric in hospitals in humanitarian settings. Antibiotic consumption in project hospitals was higher than those reported from non-humanitarian settings. Routine systematic antibiotic consumption monitoring systems should be implemented in hospitals, accompanied by prescribing audits and point-prevalence surveys, to inform about the volume and appropriateness of antibiotic use and to support antimicrobial stewardship efforts in humanitarian settings.

“It’s different here” Afghan refugee maternal health experiences in the United States,"Heidi J. Worabo, Fatima Safi, Sara L. Gill, Moshtagh Farokhi",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-024-06678-7,2024-7-16,['The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Human Rights']","['Maternal Health', 'Traditional Practices']",,"The article examines maternal healthcare experiences of Afghan women in the United States, offering insights into their perspectives on healthcare access, cultural challenges, and communication barriers. Here’s a summary of the key points:

1. **Context**: Many Afghan women have resettled in the U.S., transitioning from a country with limited healthcare access due to economic and social challenges. This historical context shapes their experiences and perspectives on healthcare in the U.S.

2. **Purpose of Research**: The study aims to explore and understand the maternal healthcare experiences of Afghan women in the U.S., highlighting specific human rights issues such as access to quality care, communication barriers, and cultural preferences that affect their care.

3. **Research Methods**: The research involved interviews with 20 Afghan women, lasting between 23 and 71 minutes each. The interviews were conducted both in person and over the phone. Demographics were collected to provide context to the narratives.

4. **Main Findings**: 
   - Afghan women appreciate the higher quality prenatal and birthing care in the U.S. compared to Afghanistan, where economic constraints and lack of medical professionals limit healthcare access.
   - They value attentive care from U.S. medical staff but face cultural discomforts, such as the presence of male healthcare providers.
   - Communication is a major barrier, with language differences complicating their interactions with healthcare providers.
   - Transportation and financial access to healthcare services are significant challenges, restricting their ability to attend appointments.
   
5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The study touches upon the importance of healthcare access, particularly Medicaid, in supporting the medical needs of Afghan women post-resettlement.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors suggest enhancing cultural understanding in healthcare settings, improving access to interpreters, and offering reproductive health education tailored to Afghan women's cultural context and language needs.

7. **Limitations**: The study's findings may be constrained by limited sample size and potential bias in recounting personal experiences. Additionally, the sensitivity of discussing reproductive health topics publicly may affect the data's comprehensiveness. Moreover, language barriers and the reliance on interpreters could potentially skew communication accuracy during the research.

By addressing these multifaceted challenges, the study highlights the critical need for culturally sensitive healthcare delivery systems that can ensure Afghan women’s rights to effective and compassionate maternal care in the U.S.","Abstract
                Background
                The number of Afghan families in the US has grown over the past two decades, yet there is a paucity of research focused on their maternal healthcare experiences. Afghan families have one of the highest fertility rates in the world and typically have large families. As the US faces rising maternal mortality rates, it is crucial to understand factors that affect health outcomes for culturally distinct groups. We aimed to better understand Afghan women’s maternal health experiences in South Texas as a step toward designing culturally sensitive care.
              
                Methods
                Using a qualitative descriptive design, twenty Afghan women who gave birth in the US within the past 2 years participated in audio-recorded interviews. The first and second authors conducted each interview using a semi-structured interview guide. The authors used an in vivo coding method and qualitative content analysis of the transcribed narrative data.
              
                Results
                We identified three broad categories with corresponding sub-categories: 1) Maternal Healthcare Experiences: pregnancy, birthing, and postpartum, 2) Communication: language barrier, relationship with husband, and health information seeking, 3) Access to Care: transportation and financing healthcare. The participants expressed perspectives of gratefulness and positive experiences, yet some described stories of poor birth outcomes that led to attitudes of mistrust and disappointment. Distinct cultural preferences were shared, providing invaluable insights for healthcare providers.
              
                Conclusions
                The fact that the Afghan culture is strikingly different than the US mainstream culture can lead to stereotypical assumptions, poor communication, and poor health outcomes.
                The voices of Afghan women should guide healthcare providers in delivering patient-centered, culturally sensitive maternity care that promotes healthy families and communities.

Prevalence of stunting and its correlates among children under 5 in Afghanistan: the potential impact of basic and full vaccination,"Omid Dadras, Charuai Suwanbamrung, Massoma Jafari, Muhammad Haroon Stanikzai",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-024-04913-w,2024-7-6,['Universitetet i Bergen'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Nutrition', 'Disease Prevention', 'Food Security', 'Equitable Healthcare Access']",,"**Summary of the Study on Child Stunting in Afghanistan**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Afghanistan faces a severe public health challenge with high rates of child stunting, a situation exacerbated by ongoing political instability, economic challenges, and a humanitarian crisis intensified by international sanctions and a reduction in foreign aid. These factors create significant food insecurity and impact children's nutrition and health outcomes.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The study aims to investigate the prevalence of child stunting in Afghanistan, identify contributing factors, and address gender disparities in stunting rates. It highlights critical human rights challenges, particularly regarding child health, nutrition, and education access, amidst the country's socio-political difficulties.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The research utilized data from a nationally representative sample, leveraging the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2022-23. This approach allows for comparison with other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and informs national-level generalizations. However, some influential variables like birth weight and breastfeeding practices were unavailable, and the study was cross-sectional, limiting causal inference.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - The stunting prevalence among Afghan children is 44.7%, showing stagnation in progress.
   - Stunting rates are higher in older children, low-income households with many children, and rural areas.
   - Female children show slightly lower stunting rates contrary to regional trends, suggesting cultural and biological factors.
   - Lower parental education, particularly for mothers, is correlated with higher stunting rates. 
   - A lack of access to health services, family planning, and adequate sanitation exacerbates stunting risks.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies Related to Human Rights:**
   The study underscores Afghanistan's inadequate legal and policy frameworks in addressing child health and nutrition. Women's restricted access to education and employment hampers effective health and childcare interventions.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors recommend comprehensive health and nutrition programs targeting family planning and healthcare equity to reduce stunting. They advocate for educational opportunities for mothers, enhanced vaccination programs, and policy changes to improve healthcare access.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   Limitations include missing data on crucial variables and reliance on self-reported data prone to bias. The cross-sectional design restricts causal conclusions. The study's context within Afghanistan's challenging political climate further complicates data collection and intervention implementation. There is also a call for longitudinal studies to deepen understanding and guide policies effectively.","Abstract
                Background
                Child stunting is prevalent in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), but an information gap remains regarding its current prevalence, correlates, and the impact of vaccination against this condition in Afghanistan. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and correlates of moderate and severe stunting and the potential impact of basic and full vaccination among children under five in Afghanistan.
              
                Methods
                This is a secondary analysis of the 2022-23 Afghanistan Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (MICS) including 32,989 children under 5. Descriptive statistics were employed to describe the distribution of independent variables and the prevalence of stunting across them. Chi-square analysis was used to examine the association between each independent variable with stunting. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the risk of stunting across different independent variables.
              
                Results
                A total of 32,989 children under 5 years old were included in this study. Of those 44.7% were stunted with 21.74% being severely stunted. Children aged 24–35 and 36–47 months faced the highest risk as compared to those aged 1–5 months. The prevalence was lower in female children and they were less likely to experience severe stunting. Stunting was more prevalent in rural areas, with children there 1.16 to 1.23 times more likely to be affected than urban counterparts. Lower wealth correlated with higher stunting. Younger maternal age at birth (≤ 18) correlated with increased stunting risks, particularly in severe cases. Parental education was inversely related to stunting; higher education levels in parents, especially fathers, were associated with lower stunting rates. Households with more than seven children showed a 25% and 44% higher risk of moderate and severe stunting, respectively, compared to families with 1–4 children. Improved sanitation, but not drinking water sources, was linked to reduced stunting in the adjusted model. Vaccination had a protective effect; in the adjusted analysis, basic and full vaccinations significantly lowered the risk of severe stunting by 46% and 41%, respectively.
              
                Conclusion
                In this nationally representative study, the prevalence of stunting was substantial (44.7%) in Afghan children. Additionally, the findings emphasize the critical factors associated with child stunting and underscore the protective role of vaccination against this condition, which provides policymakers with directions for policy efforts and intervention strategies to reduce child stunting in Afghanistan.

Here's a summary based on your requested points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Afghanistan has traditionally high fertility rates influenced by socio-cultural factors and limited access to education and healthcare. Despite improvements over time, fertility rates and gender-based violence remain significant issues impacting Afghan women.

2. **Purpose of Research and Human Rights Questions**: The study aims to explore the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and fertility rates. It addresses human rights concerns regarding the impact of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse on women's reproductive choices and autonomy.

3. **Research Methods**: The study employs discrete-time survival regression models to calculate Total Fertility Rate (TFR), Parity Progression Ratios (PPRs), and closed birth intervals (CBI). Data is transformed into person-year data for detailed analysis of transition periods, using Stata 13 software. The study incorporates both controlled and uncontrolled variables to estimate fertility outcomes.

4. **Main Findings**: The research identifies a correlation between intimate partner violence and fertility patterns, indicating that IPV can affect reproductive behavior and outcomes. High parity progression ratios suggest ongoing reproductive pressure on Afghan women amid experiences of violence.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The article does not delve into Afghanistan's legal frameworks or policies related to human rights or intimate partner violence, focusing instead on statistical analysis.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that intimate partner violence is a significant predictor of fertility behaviors in Afghanistan. They recommend policy interventions aimed at addressing gender-based violence and providing support and education to empower women.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study's limitations include potential biases due to self-reported data on violence, which may be underreported. Additionally, the sociopolitical environment in Afghanistan may hinder comprehensive data collection and impact the generalizability of findings due to cultural and regional variations within the country.","Abstract
                Background
                spousal violence against women (SVAW) is a common form of violence that occurs within the family context, with spouses being the main perpetrators. Afghanistan has one of the highest rates of SVAW in the world, and its impact on reproductive health and fertility is not well understood. This study aims to investigate the extent to which SVAW influences the total fertility rate (TFR) of Afghan women.
              
                Methods
                In this study, a regression model of discrete-time survival models was used to calculate the total fertility rate (TFR), parity progression ratio (PPRs), and average closed birth intervals (CBI) between two children. The method used in this study has its roots in the works of Griffin Finney (1983) and was further developed by Redford et al. (2010). The study population utilized the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey, and sample weights were used to ensure accurate estimates for the population of Afghanistan as a whole.
              
                Results
                The study found that women in Afghanistan who have experienced SV are more likely to progress to the next parity, start childbearing faster, and continue to do so. Women who have not experienced SV tend to progress to higher parities at a slower pace during their initial reproductive years. The study also suggests that women with spousal violence (SV) experience may have slightly higher fertility rates and shorter birth intervals for certain birth orders, although the differences between the two groups are generally small. Specifically, the total fertility rate (TFR) for women who experienced SV was 6.9, while the TFR for women who did not experience SV was 6.2.
              
                Conclusions
                These results provide valuable information for policymakers and public health professionals in developing effective policies and programs to address SVAW and improve maternal and child health outcomes in Afghanistan.

Here's a summary based on the points you provided:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The political landscape in Afghanistan changed significantly after August 2021, improving security in certain regions while increasing violence in others, like Panjshir. This shift affected internal mobility and access to healthcare facilities, with some areas experiencing increased access due to reduced conflict.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The research aims to assess the accessibility and quality of healthcare services in Afghanistan under the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) framework. It investigates the challenges and barriers faced by the population in accessing healthcare, particularly focusing on resource shortages, financial burdens, and systemic inequalities affecting various demographics, including ethnic minorities and women.

3. **Research Methods**: The study involved interviews with 43 participants, including representatives from government hospitals across nine provinces and NGO staff. The study categorizes findings using the UHC framework, which includes coverage of health services, financial protection, and population coverage.

4. **Main Findings**:
   - **Socio-Political and Epidemiological Changes**: Improved security has increased mobility and access to healthcare in some urban areas, while violence has restricted access in others. The number of patients in government clinics has risen due to security improvements, financial strains, and NGO clinic closures.
   - **Healthcare Coverage**: There are severe shortages in healthcare facilities, staff, equipment, and medication, especially in rural areas. Essential healthcare services are lacking, and there is substantial pressure on existing resources.
   - **Healthcare Quality**: Concerns about the quality of healthcare professionals’ education and available medications persist. Facilities are often inadequate, affecting patient care and outcomes.
   - **Financial Protection**: Despite claims of free basic services, patients frequently incur out-of-pocket expenses, contributing to financial hardship. Healthcare workers also face financial insecurity due to low and irregular pay.
   - **Population Coverage**: Geographically remote communities and women face significant barriers to healthcare access, exacerbated by societal and economic factors. Discrimination against ethnic minorities is also reported to have intensified.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: There is an evident gap between government healthcare policies and the actual resources and infrastructure available, impeding the realization of adequate healthcare services.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that Afghanistan's healthcare system is under severe strain, with dire resource shortages and systemic inefficiencies. They recommend increased support from international NGOs, better resource allocation, and policy reforms to address financial and systemic barriers to healthcare.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study's limitations include the political climate's influence on data collection and accessibility, as well as potential bias due to the sensitive nature of healthcare and human rights issues in the region. Unpredictable socio-political conditions may also affect the study's applicability over time.","Abstract
                Background
                Following the change of government in August 2021, the social and economic landscape of Afghanistan deteriorated into an economic and humanitarian crisis. Afghans continue to struggle to access basic healthcare services, making Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in the country a major challenge. The aim of this study was to perform a qualitative investigation into the main access to care challenges in Afghanistan and whether these challenges have been influenced by the recent socio-political developments, by examining the perspectives of health professionals and hospital directors working in the country.

                Health professionals working in facilities run by an international non-government organisation, which has maintained continuous operations since 1999 and has become a key health reference point for the population, alongside the public health system, and hospital directors working in government hospitals were recruited to participate in an in-depth qualitative study using semi-structured interviews.
              
                Results
                A total of 43 participants from ten provinces were interviewed in this study. Four issues were identified as critical barriers to achieving UHC in Afghanistan: (1) the lack of quality human resources; (2) the suboptimal management of chronic diseases and trauma; (3) the inaccessibility of necessary health services due to financial hardship; (4) the unequal accessibility of care for different demographic groups.
              
                Conclusions
                Health professionals and hospital directors shed light on weaknesses in the Afghan health system highlighting chronic issues and issues that have deteriorated as a result of the 2021 socio-political changes. In order to improve access to care, future healthcare system reforms should consider the perspectives of Afghan professionals working in the country, who are in close contact with Afghan patients and communities.

Political climate constraints and the exclusion of views from those entirely outside the healthcare system could affect generalizability. However, efforts were made to include diverse participant backgrounds to mitigate this bias.","Abstract
                Background
                The Taliban takeover in August 2021 ended a decades-long conflict in Afghanistan. Yet, along with improved security, there have been collateral changes, such as the exacerbation of the economic crisis and brain drain. Although these changes have altered the lives of Afghans in many ways, it is unclear whether they have affected access to care. This study aimed to analyse Afghans’ access to care and how this access has changed after August 2021.
              
                Methods
                The study relied on the collaboration with the non-governmental organisation EMERGENCY, running a network of three hospitals and 41 First Aid Posts in 10 Afghan provinces. A 67-item questionnaire about access to care changes after August 2021 was developed and disseminated at EMERGENCY facilities. Ordinal logistic regression was used to evaluate whether access to care changes were associated with participants’ characteristics.
              
                Results
                In total, 1807 valid responses were returned. Most respondents (54.34%) reported improved security when visiting healthcare facilities, while the ability to reach facilities has remained stable for the majority of them (50.28%). Care is less affordable for the majority of respondents (45.82%). Female respondents, those who are unmarried and not engaged, and patients in the Panjshir province were less likely to perceive improvements in access to care.
              
                Conclusions
                Findings outline which dimensions of access to care need resource allocation. The inability to pay for care is the most relevant barrier to access care after August 2021 and must therefore be prioritised. Women and people from the Panjshir province may require ad hoc interventions to improve their access to care.

The study underscores the profound impact of COVID-19 on healthcare access in South Asia, suggesting reforms to address these vulnerabilities in future health crises.","Abstract
                Background
                COVID-19 rapidly spread through South Asian countries and overwhelmed the health systems that were unprepared for such an outbreak. Evidence from high-income countries showed that COVID-19 impacted healthcare utilization, including medication use, but empirical evidence is lacking in South Asia. This study aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on healthcare utilization and medication use in South Asia.
              
                Method
                The current study used longitudinal data from the ‘Premise Health Service Disruption Survey’ 2020 and 2021. The countries of interest were limited to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and India. In these surveys, data related to healthcare utilization and medication use were collected for three-time points; ‘Pre-COVID phase’, ‘Initial phase of COVID-19 outbreak’, and ‘One year of COVID-19 outbreak’. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) along with McNemar’s test, Kruskal–Wallis test and χ2 test were applied in this study following the conceptualization of Andersen’s healthcare utilization model.
              
                Result
                The use of healthcare and medication was unevenly impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and India. Immediately after the COVID-19 outbreak, respondents in Bangladesh reported around four times higher incomplete healthcare utilization compared to pre-COVID phase. In contrast, respondents in Afghanistan reported lower incomplete utilization of healthcare in a similar context. In the post COVID-19 outbreak, non-adherence to medication use was significantly higher in Afghanistan (OR:1.7; 95%CI:1.6,1.9) and India (OR:1.3; 95%CI:1.1,1.7) compared to pre-COVID phase. Respondents of all three countries who sought assistance to manage non-communicable diseases (NCDs) had higher odds (Afghanistan: OR:1.5; 95%CI:1.3,1.8; Bangladesh: OR: 3.7; 95%CI:1.9,7.3; India: OR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.4,3.6) of non-adherence to medication use after the COVID-19 outbreak compared to pre-COVID phase.
              
                Conclusion
                The present study documented important evidence of the influence of COVID-19 epidemic on healthcare utilization and medication use in three countries of South Asia. Lessons learned from this study can feed into policy responses to the crisis and preparedness for future pandemics.

Barriers to healthcare utilization among married women in Afghanistan: the role of asset ownership and women’s autonomy,"Manzoor Ahmad Malik, Ratnesh Sinha, Angelin Priya, Mohammad Hifz Ur Rahman",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-024-18091-y,2024-2-26,['Menzies Health Institute Queensland'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Human Rights']","['Maternal Health', 'Gender']",,"The article discusses the challenges related to maternal health in Afghanistan, a country with a fragile public health system exacerbated by socio-economic and cultural barriers. Below is a summary highlighting key points related to the article:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Afghanistan is one of the most war-torn countries globally, which contributes to a fragile public health system. The socio-economic and political instability impacts women disproportionately, leading to significant challenges in healthcare accessibility, particularly maternal health services.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The study aims to address the gap in research concerning barriers to healthcare service utilization among currently married mothers in Afghanistan. The focus is on understanding the risk factors associated with these barriers, including women's empowerment and asset ownership, which have not been extensively studied in this context.

3. **Research Methods**: The study undertakes a comprehensive analysis through a literature review of existing studies. It focuses on barriers to accessing maternal healthcare services, exploring socio-economic, cultural, and empowerment-related factors.

4. **Main Findings**: The research identifies significant disparities in maternal health outcomes in Afghanistan. Many women face barriers such as lack of autonomy, financial constraints, and cultural obstacles that hinder their access to necessary healthcare services. These challenges contribute to underutilization of antenatal and post-natal care.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Institutions**: The article underscores Afghanistan's reliance on a fragile health system heavily supported by foreign donors. Despite improvements in health indicators over the past decade, the country struggles with high maternal mortality rates and suboptimal utilization of health services due to unresolved socio-economic and cultural issues.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that enhancing women's empowerment and addressing socio-cultural barriers are crucial for improving maternal health outcomes in Afghanistan. They suggest that targeted interventions and policies informed by this study's insights could facilitate better health service utilization. They also emphasize the importance of conducting sociodemographic surveys to inform future initiatives.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study's limitations include challenges related to the country's political climate, which can affect data collection and availability. The sensitivity around human rights issues, particularly concerning women’s empowerment in a conflict-ridden environment, also poses significant challenges for comprehensive research.

Overall, the article calls for a focused effort on women's empowerment and systemic reforms to overcome the barriers facing Afghan women in accessing maternal healthcare services.","AbstractWomen face multiple socio-economic, cultural, contextual, and perceived barriers in health service utilization. Moreover, poor autonomy and financial constraints act as crucial factors to their healthcare accessibility. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to study the association between health care utilization barriers and women empowerment, including asset ownership among currently married women in Afghanistan. Data of 28,661 currently married women from Afghanistan demographic health survey (2015) was used to carry out this study. Barriers to access healthcare were computed based on problems related to permission, money, distance, and companionship, whereas women empowerment and asset ownership were computed as potential covariates along with other socio-economic risk factors. Bivariate and logistic analysis was carried out to study the association and odds of explanatory variables. Our results confirm the significant and strong association between the barriers to access healthcare and various explanatory variables. Women having any decision-making autonomy are less likely to face any odds [(AOR = 0.56, p &lt; 0.001), CI: 0.51–0.61] among the currently married women than those who don’t have any decision-making authority. Similarly, women who justify their beating for some specific reasons face the greater difficulty of accessing health care [(AOR = 1.76, p &lt; 0.001), CI: 1.61–1.93]. In terms of asset ownership, women having any asset ownership (land or household) are less likely to face any barriers in health services utilization given the lower odds [(AOR = 0.91, p &lt; 0.001), CI: 0.90–0.98]. Accessing maternal health is a crucial policy challenge in Afghanistan. A substantial proportion of women face barriers related to approval, money, distance, and companionship while accessing the health services utilization in Afghanistan. Similarly, women empowerment and asset ownership are significantly associated with health service accessibility. This paper therefore suggests for some policy interventions to strengthen the healthcare needs of women and ensure healthcare accessibility by scaling down these potential barriers like poor autonomy, asset ownership and domestic violence."

                Objective
                This study aimed to determine the association between body mass index (BMI) and abdominal obesity with hypertension among the South Asian adults (18–69 years).
              
                Methods
                This study utilized the nationally representative WHO STEPwise approach to surveillance data (n = 24,413) from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Hypertension was defined as having a systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher, a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or higher, and/or taking antihypertensive medications. A waist circumference ≥ 90 cm in men and ≥ 80 cm in women was considered as abdominal obesity. BMI was categorized according to Asia-specific cutoff and overweight was defined as BMI of 23.0–27.5 kg/m2 and obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 27.5 kg/m2. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the association between BMI and abdominal obesity with hypertension. The odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was reported.
              
                Results
                Abdominal obesity increased the odds of hypertension 31%-105% compared to those who did not have abdominal obesity (OR: Afghanistan: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.27–3.31; Bangladesh: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.18–2.04; Bhutan: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.03–1.66; Nepal: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.31–2.18; Sri Lanka:1.55; 95% CI: 1.23–1.95). The odds increased among participants with both overweight/obesity and abdominal obesity. In all five countries under study, participants with both overweight and abdominal obesity (OR: Afghanistan: 2.75; 95% CI: 1.75–4.34; Bangladesh: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.90–3.37; Bhutan: 2.22; 95% CI: 1.64–3.00; Nepal: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.54–2.81; Sri Lanka: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.77–2.98), as well as those with obesity and abdominal obesity (OR: Afghanistan: 6.94; 95% CI: 4.68–10.30; Bangladesh: 2.95; 95% CI: 2.19–3.97; Bhutan: 3.02; 95% CI: 2.23–4.09; Nepal: 4.40; 95% CI: 3.05–6.34; Sri Lanka: 3.96; 95% CI: 2.94–5.32), exhibited higher odds of having hypertension as compared to participants with a normal BMI and no abdominal obesity.
              
                Conclusion
                Having both abdominal obesity and overweight/obesity increased the odds of hypertension among South Asian adults. Preventing overweight/obesity and abdominal obesity is necessary for preventing the burden of hypertension in South Asia.

Women’s experience of childbirth care in health facilities: a qualitative assessment of respectful maternity care in Afghanistan,"Partamin Manalai, Nasratullah Ansari, Hannah Tappis, Young Mi Kim, Jelle Stekelenburg, Jos van Roosmalen, Sheena Currie",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-023-06234-9,2024-1-10,['Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Athena Instituut'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Human Rights']","['Maternal Health', 'Gender']",,"The study investigates the dynamics of maternity care in Afghanistan, specifically examining the interactions between women using maternity services, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers/policymakers. Conducted across four populous provinces—Balkh, Kandahar, Herat, and Nangarhar—the research aims to explore the motivators and deterrents for using health facilities during childbirth, the experiences of care quality, and the awareness and implementation of rights-based respectful maternity care (RMC).

### 1. Historical, Political, and Social Context
Afghanistan's socio-cultural context, marked by deeply ingrained gender norms and a predominantly oral culture, plays a significant role in the delivery and perception of maternity care. Challenges such as insecurity, financial barriers, and traditional beliefs influence healthcare behaviors and accessibility.

### 2. Purpose and Human Rights Challenges
The research addresses human rights in the context of maternity care by examining the availability, quality, and accessibility of care, as well as the respect for women's rights during childbirth. It highlights the barriers women face, including financial constraints and mistreatment, alongside motivators like trust in healthcare providers.

### 3. Research Methods
The study employed qualitative methods, utilizing focus group discussions (FGDs) with women and healthcare providers and key informant interviews (KIIs) with healthcare managers and policymakers. A purposeful sampling method was used to select district hospitals for the study. All discussions and interviews were facilitated by a team of female researchers proficient in local languages.

### 4. Main Findings on Human Rights Violations and Trends
Key themes include:
- **Motivators and Deterrents:** Trust in knowledgeable providers and the availability of medicine motivate women to use health facilities, while factors like financial constraints, cultural stigmas, and security concerns deter usage.
- **Providers' Behavior:** Although generally positive, instances of mistreatment, such as discrimination against poorer women and verbal abuse, were reported.
- **Rights Awareness:** Many participants were unaware of their rights concerning maternity care and faced barriers like unauthorized out-of-pocket payments.

### 5. Examination of Legal Frameworks
While the study acknowledges the existence of the MoPH’s Patient’s Charter of Rights, it found that awareness and implementation were inconsistent. Providers and key informants often lacked full knowledge of the charter’s principles.

### 6. Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations
The authors conclude that both women and healthcare providers recognize the need for improved respectful maternity care. Recommendations include increasing awareness of patient rights, enhancing training for providers, ensuring adequate facilities and resources, and addressing cultural barriers that prevent women from accessing care.

### 7. Limitations of the Study
The research faced limitations such as heightened insecurity that restricted field-testing and potential biases due to cultural norms that may influence the candidness of participants. Additionally, political instability and resource constraints in health facilities might have impacted data availability and reliability.","Abstract
                Background
                Respectful maternity care (RMC) remains a key challenge in Afghanistan, despite progress on improving maternal and newborn health during 2001—2021. A qualitative study was conducted in 2018 to provide evidence on the situation of RMC in health facilities in Afghanistan. The results are useful to inform strategies to provide RMC in Afghanistan in spite of the humanitarian crisis due to Taliban’s takeover in 2021.
              
                Methods
                Focus group discussions were conducted with women (4 groups, 43 women) who had used health facilities for giving birth and with providers (4 groups, 21 providers) who worked in these health facilities. Twenty key informant interviews were conducted with health managers and health policy makers. Motivators for, deterrents from using, awareness about and experiences of maternity care in health facilities were explored.
              
                Results
                Women gave birth in facilities for availability of maternity care and skilled providers, while various verbal and physical forms of mistreatment were identified as deterrents from facility use by women, providers and key informants. Low awareness, lack of resources and excessive workload were identified among the reasons for violation of RMC.
              
                Conclusion
                Violation of RMC is unacceptable. Awareness of women and providers about the rights of women to respectful maternity care, training of providers on the subject, monitoring of care to prevent mistreatment, and conditioning any future technical and financial assistance to commitments to RMC is recommended.

This qualitative study explored determinants of access to primary prevention and screening for HIV among people who inject drugs (PWID) residing in border communities of Gorno-Badakhshan, Tajikistan and Badakhshan, Afghanistan. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with PWID, community leaders, and healthcare workers. The social-ecological model was used to inform a thematic analysis of determinants of access. Results There were no preventive or screening services for HIV in the border districts of Afghanistan. Barriers to accessing HIV-related services in Tajikistan, and to accessing general health services in Afghanistan, included: lack of knowledge about HIV, inaccessible communities with poor infrastructure, discrimination and violence against women, and stigmatization of PWID and people living with HIV. Access to HIV-related and other health services by PWID was facilitated by community leader support, family support, outreach services, and linkage of harm reduction services with HIV testing and care. Conclusion Urgent interventions are needed to stem the escalating HIV epidemic in Afghanistan and enhance existing services in Tajik border communities.

The aim of this study was to explain gynecologic cancer knowledge, attitudes, and cultural beliefs of Afghan refugee women living in Türkiye. This research was carried out as a descriptive phenomenological design for qualitative research. The study was conducted at the Refugee Support Center Association in Eskişehir, Türkiye, and data were collected between January and April 2023, guided by a semi-structured interview guide. Nineteen Afghan refugee women were interviewed. A purposive sampling method was used to recruit participants. Content analysis method was used for data analysis. Four overarching themes that described Afghan women’s gynecologic cancer knowledge, attitudes, and cultural beliefs were identified: (a) limited awareness and knowledge of gynecological cancer among women, (b) women’s attitudes toward gynecological cancers, (c) women’s cultural beliefs regarding gynecological cancer, and (d) healthcare system factors. In line with the main themes, subthemes were created for each main theme. Afghan refugee women, who were in the double risk group as both women and refugees, had insufficient knowledge of gynecological cancers, and their cultural beliefs and attitudes played an essential role in their access to gynecological cancer-related preventive healthcare services. It is recommended that training be planned to increase the awareness and knowledge of Afghan women on gynecological cancers, considering their cultural characteristics. "

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context**: Maternal mortality has decreased globally over the years, but progress is unequal, especially in low and middle-income countries like Afghanistan. The underutilization of ANC services in these regions contributes to high maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The research seeks to identify predictors of ANC service utilization among Afghan women. It highlights the challenge of insufficient ANC access, which constitutes a significant public health and human rights issue by affecting women's health and autonomy.

3. **Research Methods**: The study uses a stratified two-stage sampling method to analyze data from 10,855 ever-married women aged 13–49 who were either recently pregnant or had given birth in the past two years. Binary logistic regression models assessed associations between ANC utilization and various sociodemographic factors.

4. **Main Findings**: Only 63.2% of women had at least one ANC visit during their last pregnancy, with significant barriers linked to literacy, knowledge of pregnancy danger signs, residential location, and media access. Rural women and those with decisions made by in-laws had lower ANC utilization. Education and media access positively influenced ANC usage.

5. **Legal Framework and Policy Examination**: The study briefly discusses the barriers posed by Afghanistan's sociopolitical climate. It suggests that policies promoting women's education and autonomy could improve ANC utilization.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors recommend prioritizing ANC service utilization through targeted interventions that emphasize female education and accessible healthcare services. They suggest that public health policy should focus on empowering women and increasing awareness of pregnancy complications.

7. **Study Limitations**: Limitations include potential recall bias, reliance on self-reported data, constraints on data variables from AHS2018, and the study's cross-sectional nature. Additionally, changes in Afghanistan's political landscape since the study, including decreased donor funding, might affect current ANC service availability.

Overall, the study underscores the need for urgent, tailored interventions to improve ANC access, thereby aiming to reduce maternal and neonatal health issues in Afghanistan.","
Background
Poor utilization of maternal healthcare services remains a public health concern in most low and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Afghanistan. Late, inadequate, or no utilization of antenatal care (ANC) services pose a great concern.


Objectives
This study assessed the predictors of ANC service utilization among Afghan pregnant women, using secondary data from the Afghanistan Health Survey 2018 (AHS2018).


Methods
In this study, we used data from 10,855 ever-married women, aged 13–49 years, who gave birth in the two years prior to the survey or those women who were currently pregnant. The outcome variable was defined as a binary variable on ANC utilization (≥1 ANC visit equals 1, and zero otherwise). We fitted a binary logistic regression model and examined the associations between ANC utilization and explanatory variables, providing findings based on univariate and multivariate analysis. STATA version 17 was employed for the data analysis.


Results
Overall, 63.2%, 22.0%, and 3.1% of women had at least one ANC visit, ≥4 ANC visits, and ≥8 ANC visits during their last pregnancy, respectively. Higher odds of ANC utilization were observed in women who could read and write (AOR = 1.55, 95%CI: 1.36–1.77), whose husbands could read and write (AOR = 1.42, 95%CI: 1.29–1.56), who knew 1 sign (AOR = 1.93, 95%CI: 1.74–2.14), 2 signs (AOR = 2.43, 95%CI: 2.17–2.71) and ≥ 3 signs (AOR = 1.55, 95%CI: 1.36–1.77) of complicated pregnancy, and those with almost daily access to radio (AOR = 1.19, 95%CI: 1.08–1.327) and TV (AOR = 1.92, 95%CI: 1.73–2.13). We also found that women with one (AOR = 0.64, 95%CI: 0.49–0.84) and more than one (AOR = 0.60, 95%CI: 0.47–0.76) parity status, those for whom in-laws and others decided for their birthplace [(AOR = 0.85, 95%CI: 0.74–0.97) and (AOR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.55–0.72), respectively], and those that resided in rural areas (AOR = 0.89, 95%CI: 0.79–1.00) had reduced odds of ANC utilization.


Conclusion
ANC service utilization is unacceptably low by pregnant women in Afghanistan. The predictors of ANC utilization identified by the study should be considered in the design of future interventions to enhance antenatal care utilization in Afghanistan.

The Afghan Murat: A Queer Subject at Transnational Crossroads,Ali Abdi,https://doi.org/10.1177/1097184X241273240,2024-8-29,['Yale University'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available," This article introduces and explores the subjectivity of a queer community in Afghanistan, the self-identified murats. Murat is a subject position that emerged in Afghanistan over the past 20 years to become a viable category of personhood and a practical term of reference among a community of non-masculine dancers and sex workers living and working in the capital (and other major cities). Based on the findings of ethnographic fieldwork conducted between 2016 and 2021 in Kabul, the article shows that the transnational and transhistorical formation of Afghan murats’ gender and sexual subjectivities has been the result of the intersection of three other categories of personhood: the South Asian hijra, the Turko-Persianate bachah, and the Afghan īzak. By studying the Afghan murat subjectivity, the article further sketches out a template for imagining the sex/gender configuration in Afghanistan, suggesting that it is non-binary and cannot be comfortably divided into the two opposing poles of the male/masculine and the female/feminine.

We aimed to investigate trends and regional disparities of burden in paediatric AD at global, regional and national levels, and to explore potential associated factors.MethodsBased on data from Global Burden of Disease study 2019, we assessed trends in burden of AD aged &lt;19 years from 1990 to 2019, including prevalent and incident cases, age‐standardised prevalence and age‐standardised incidence. For potential associated factors, correlations of above trends and indexes of socio‐economic status (sociodemographic index, SDI) and health service coverage (universal health coverage index, UHCI) were evaluated. We conducted decomposition analysis to understand the net contribution of population‐level factors and their contribution proportions on changes of prevalent and incident cases, including age structure, population change and epidemiological change.ResultsGlobal prevalent and incident cases of paediatric AD increased by about 5.7 and 0.7 million between 1990 and 2019, respectively. Global age‐standardised prevalence and incidence decreased by −0.17% (−0.19% to −0.16%) and −0.12% (−0.13% to −0.11%) per year from 1990 to 2019, respectively. Regionally, the highest increase of prevalent and incident cases was in low SDI region (by 96.77% and 84.85%); the highest decrease of age‐standardised prevalence and incidence was in high SDI regions (by −0.20% and −0.27% per year). The correlation analyses identified significant negative correlations between trends and SDI and UHCI. Population change was a major driver of case rise; epidemiological change and age structure showed negative impact of case rise. Regional disparities in contribution of three population‐level factors were seen, including net contribution direction (positive or negative) and contribution proportion levels.ConclusionGlobal paediatric AD case numbers increased, primarily due to population growth. Prevalence and incidence decreased slightly. Geographic inequalities were seen. Developing region‐specific strategies targeting potential factors is essential to reduce paediatric AD burden."

Amid the global endeavour to achieve SDGs, these marginalised nations assume a pivotal role, confronting distinctive challenges and opportunities. We employ meticulous analysis and structural equation modelling techniques to unveil a complex network of relationships among diverse socio‐economic indicators and unemployment across 27 low‐income countries, encompassing nations such as Afghanistan, Zambia, and others. Our empirical findings underscore the paramount importance of economic advancement, as epitomised by GDP per capita, in fostering employment prospects. Concurrently, environmental endeavours, epitomised by CO2 emissions, underscore the potential of green employment in mitigating unemployment. Investments in education and healthcare, as indicated by primary completion rates and life expectancy, emerge as pivotal determinants of employability. Moreover, access to clean energy sources and mobile cellular subscriptions indirectly influence unemployment rates, underscoring the multifaceted nature of the issue. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the intricate interplay between economic progress and social well‐being. These insights give policymakers invaluable direction, stressing the significance of tailored strategies that harness education, healthcare, technology, and environmental initiatives to alleviate unemployment, cultivate inclusive growth, and advance the overarching aspirations of sustainable development in low‐income countries."
75 Years of women representation in Afghanistan: Looking back to look forward,"Parwiz Mosamim, Jean‐Patrick Villeneuve",https://doi.org/10.1002/pad.2043,2024-3-23,['Università della Svizzera italiana'],Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"AbstractThis article analyzes barriers and facilitators to Afghan women's representation in the last 75 years, from Zahir Shah (1933–1973) to Ashraf Ghani (2014–2021) and now under the Taliban (2021–…). We conducted a qualitative analysis using administrative documents and related academic contributions from each period to address this topic. The analysis shows that the representation of women in Afghanistan's public administration (PA) has been limited and passive in terms of both numbers and impacts. Historically, Afghanistan's PA has remained a mostly patriarchal system, where prejudice and gender‐based discrimination are a reality in government organizational structures. Our findings show that socio‐economic and political realities have contributed to gender inequality and the underrepresentation of Afghan women in PA. These realities include international invasions, conflicts, frequent regime changes, and cultural elements, which encompass a strong traditional culture, specific religious and patriarchal mindsets, and an overall lack of attention to gender issues. Results also reveal that over the past 75 years, women have not been actively involved in the development and decision‐making processes in the country. As a result, Afghanistan has never experienced a representative PA that mirrors the demographical groups of society, notably women. This study indicates that the interests of Afghan women have mostly been ignored in the policy‐making process and that issues of diversity and gender equality in PA were not on the agenda of the different Afghan regimes."
Supporting caregivers of children living with disability in a humanitarian context: Realist-informed evaluation of the € Mighty Children' programme in Afghanistan,"Natalie Evans, Noorwhiza Ahmadi, Alice Morgan, Sadia Zalmai, Kate M Milner, Mohamed Faiz Atif, Hamish R Graham",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2023-012989,2024-9-10,"['Albury Wodonga Health', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute""]",Article,1,Yes,"['Humanitarian and Development Assistance', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Maternal Health', 'Disability Support', 'Disaster Risk Reduction']",,"**Summary of the Article:**

1. **Context:**
   Afghanistan, having experienced four decades of conflict, faces significant challenges related to disability, particularly amidst collapsed essential services and stigma. The country’s social networks and caregiver roles are heavily gendered, putting a substantial burden on caregivers, especially women, who often lack formal support and experience social isolation.

2. **Research Purpose:**
   The study aimed to evaluate the Mighty Children support programme, designed to improve the quality of life (QOL) of caregivers and children living with disabilities in Afghanistan, focusing on caregiver-reported outcomes and exploring the programme’s effectiveness across different contexts.

3. **Methods:**
   The study employed a mixed-methods approach using both quantitative and qualitative data collection. It was set in Kabul and involved before-and-after measurements to assess QOL changes. Caregivers participated in nine weekly sessions incorporating Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) strategies designed to improve caregiver resilience and support.

4. **Main Findings:**
   Caregivers reported significant improvements in their QOL and family functioning. The programme enhanced caregiver psychological resilience and altered parenting practices, leading to more nurturing home environments and greater child inclusion. Increased acceptance, mindfulness, and engagement in value-driven actions were important mechanisms facilitating these changes.

5. **Legal and Policy Framework:**
   The study did not explicitly examine Afghanistan’s legal frameworks regarding human rights but highlighted the lack of adequate services and support for families with disabilities, which remains an area for policy development and implementation.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The programme was effective in reducing caregiver frustration and promoting a more inclusive mindset. The authors recommend further scaling of similar interventions, culturally adapted and contextually sensitive, to improve caregiver and child well-being in similar low-resource settings.

7. **Study Limitations:**
   Limitations included the inherently complex and variable political climate of Afghanistan, which affected logistical aspects such as facilitator training during the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions in conducting personal interviews. Moreover, the reliance on self-reported outcomes and the focus on female caregivers may not fully capture the broader familial and societal impacts.

The study underscores the effectiveness of participatory support interventions in conflict settings but also highlights the potential challenges in scalability and the need for policy-driven improvements in disability support frameworks in such contexts.","IntroductionTo ensure that humanitarian action is disability-inclusive, evidence is needed to understand how different strategies to support children living with disabilities and their families can work in these settings. Evidence from other contexts suggests support groups can improve caregiver quality of life (QOL). This study reports an evaluation of the ‘Mighty Children’programme a participatory educational support group programme for caregivers of children living with disability in Kabul province, Afghanistan.MethodsWe conducted a mixed-methods realist-informed before-and-after study to measure change in caregiver-reported QOL and explore how and for whom the programme worked, and in what contexts. Female caregivers of children with any disability were recruited through clinics in urban Kabul (n=3) and rural Paghman district (n=3). We collected quantitative data on QOL pre/post programme using the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory Family Impact Module (PedsQL-FIM). Qualitative data were collected through facilitator and participant focus groups postprogramme.Results118 caregivers participated in two cohorts (November 2020, February 2021). Caregivers expressed a significant increase in QOL from baseline to programme completion (t(125)=−10.7, p≤0.0001). Participation in cohort 2 was associated with the greatest PedsQL-FIM change.Qualitative data revealed positive changes postprogramme in five key areas: caregiver mindset, parenting practices, disability-inclusive behaviours, psychological well-being and child functioning. These changes were seen as both outcomes and mechanisms influencing the primary outcome of QOL. Mechanisms that mediated these changes included increased knowledge of disability and the core acceptance and commitment therapy components of mindfulness and acceptance.ConclusionTheMighty Childrencaregiver support programme for children living with disability in Afghanistan was associated with improved caregiver QOL. Further studies are warranted to explore pathways to scale, sustainability and potential application in other settings."

Two of the main greenhouse gases that cause the greenhouse effect and raise global temperatures are carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides. In this review paper, we investigated the effects of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides on climate change and the effects of climate change on Afghanistan. We found that high concentrations of carbon dioxide, which is now CO2 levels, have increased by 50% than before the Industrial Revolution, contributing to a rise in global temperature and precipitation. At the same time, Nitrous oxide is an important greenhouse gas, with 310-fold higher potential for global warming than CO2 and leads to the depletion of stratospheric Ozone and other Nitrogen oxides, has a significant impact on plant health, including effects on chlorophyll levels, oxidative stress, and antioxidant responses. Afghanistan’s climate change is predicted to increase the country’s prevalence of illnesses linked to dust storms and poor air quality, especially in Kabul, the nation’s capital. In addition, air pollution in Kabul is also likely to increase as a result of climate change. The alarming impacts of air pollution, with more than 3,000 deaths attributed to air pollution annually. Additionally, at least 700,000 individuals in Kabul have experienced various respiratory diseases. Due to climate change, Afghanistan’s total glacier area has shrunk by 13.8%. In 2023, Afghanistan experienced early snow melt and below-average precipitation, causing second-season and irrigated crops to have less access to water. Reducing emissions and coping with the changing climate are essential steps towards tackling the complex issues these gases present and their wider effects on the environment and human health."

Beyond its categorization as a reproductive health concern, infertility emerges as a substantial independent risk factor for the development of various mental health disorders. The current study aims to investigate the prevalence of depression among women experiencing infertility compared to fertile women in Herat city, Afghanistan.MethodsThis hospital‐based case‐control study was conducted in Herat city, Afghanistan, during the latter half of 2023 on women aged 15–49. Sociodemographic and infertility data were gathered by a gynecologist using a structured questionnaire with 14 items. Assessment of depression employed the Dari‐translated version of the Patient Health Questionnaire. The data were scored and categorized following the instrument's guidelines. To examine the association between categorical variables, a chi‐square test was conducted, with a significance level set at 0.05 for all analyses. These statistical procedures were performed using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 27.ResultsOur investigation revealed a statistically significant association (p &lt; 0.001) between infertility and depression. Infertility was associated with a markedly increased risk of depression, as evidenced by a prevalence of 79.0% in infertile women compared to 44.4% in fertile women. The study found a link between depression, health, and nutritional status in both infertile and fertile participants. Notably, within the infertile group, the longer a woman struggled with infertility, the more likely she was to experience depression.ConclusionGiven the substantial prevalence and important correlates of depression among infertile women in Herat, Afghanistan, it is imperative for policymakers, mental health professionals, and gynecologists to specifically address the mental well‐being of this vulnerable population."

                  Background
                  Following the Taliban’s resurgence, Afghan girls were probited from attending school and university, likely causing adverse psychological effects. Therefore, the present study investigated depression, suicidal ideation, and quality of life (QoL) among Afghan girls banned from education by the Taliban.
               
               
                  Methods
                  A survey study assessed depression, suicidal ideation, and QoL among 426 females prohibited from attending secondary schools, high schools, and universities by the Taliban. The study used the CES-D 20 Scale to assess depression, and the WHOQOL-Bref Questionnaire to assess QoL. Associations between variables were tested with chi-square tests, and predictors of QoL were analyzed through multivariate regression analysis.
               
               
                  Results
                  Among the 426 participants, 87.6% exhibited depression symptoms and 49.8% reported suicidal thoughts. Significant predictors of overall QoL included monthly family income (B = 0.147, P = 0.001), recent others’ behavior toward participants (B = −0.247, P &amp;lt; 0.001), physical illness (B = 0.110, P = 0.011), experiencing a recent traumatic event (B = 0.108, P = 0.015), depression (B = −0.159, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and suicidal ideation (B = −0.187, P &amp;lt; 0.001).
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  In Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, the results indicated that female students who have been prohibited from studying in classes have a high prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation. Having depression and suicidal ideation significantly predicted decreased quality of life among female students.

Griffiths",https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.70018,2024-8-29,['Herat Regional Hospital'],Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"AbstractBackground and AimsSleep is a complex physiological process during which the body and mind enter a period of rest. For a healthy lifestyle, different cohort groups can be affected in different ways. One such cohort is healthcare workers (HCWs)—an unexplored group in Afghanistan. Therefore, the present study examined the association between a range of sociodemographic factors including having night shift work and sleep quality among Afghan HCWs.MethodsA cross‐sectional survey was administered in January 2023 among HCWs (N = 342) in the Herat province of Afghanistan. The survey examined sleep quality and its association with a range of sociodemographic factors among HCWs. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association of sleep quality with sociodemographic characteristics among HCWs. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess the sleep quality among HCWs.ResultsA total of 342 HCWs participated in the present study with an age range of 18 to 60 years. The mean age of the participants was 28.90 years (SD ± 8.10). Just over half of the participants were male (50.3%). Of the 342 participants, 58.5% reported poor sleep quality. Being married status, having higher number of children, not being a doctor, having low economic status, working night shifts, and having a traumatic event occur during past month were among the main variables associated with sleep quality among Afghan HCWs. Multiple regression analysis indicated that having high income [negatively] (AOR = 4.132, p = 0.002), working night shifts [positively] (AOR = 0.288, p &lt; 0.001), and having a traumatic event occur during past month [positively] (AOR = 0.504, p = 0.007) were significantly associated with sleep quality.ConclusionThe study suggests the need for Afghan health employers to create a healthy work environment that prioritizes the well‐being of their employees by limiting overtime hours, providing rest breaks during long shifts, and ensuring that HCWs have access to necessary resources for coping with work‐related stressors. These policies would promote the overall health and well‐being of the workforce and would likely lead to better patient care outcomes."
US–Afghanistan Relations Post-withdrawal: Is There a Future?,"Zabih Ullah Shahnan, Ejaz Hussain",https://doi.org/10.1177/23477970241265740,2024-9-1,['Kardan University'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available," Since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, no country, including the United States (US), has yet recognised the former. The US has consistently urged the regime to comply with the Doha agreement that emphasised an inclusive government. Moreover, the Biden administration has repeatedly asked the regime to respect human rights and allow girls education and employment, but in vain. What explains the divergences in US–Afghanistan relations post-withdrawal? What is the trajectory of the US–Taliban ties in the current context? Above all, is there any possibility of the US recognition of the Taliban regime in the foreseeable future? Based on primary data, it is posited that the relations between the US and the Taliban-controlled Afghanistan are divergent and currently antagonistic due to the Taliban’s non-compliance with the Doha agreement. Futuristically, the study explores three scenarios to predict US–Afghanistan relations. First, there is a likelihood of US–Afghanistan rapprochement if the Taliban do the US bidding. Second, in cases of non-compliance, the US would get tough on the regime in terms of further sanctions. However, the Taliban would consolidate (informal) ties with China, Russia and other regional countries, including Pakistan. Third, the US has the military capabilities to do regime change in Afghanistan in case of another 9/11-type incident in the US. "
The Scourge of Poliomyelitis in Pakistan: Barrier towards its eradication,Aisha Mehnaz,https://doi.org/10.47391/JPMA.24-67,2024-8-23,['Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences'],Editorial,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Governance']","['Disease Prevention', 'International Community']",,"The article discusses the persistent challenge of polio eradication, focusing primarily on Pakistan, with a backdrop of relevant historical, political, and social contexts.

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   - Polio, a disease caused by the poliovirus, leads to permanent paralysis and has been targeted for eradication through vaccination. Historically, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) launched in 1988 significantly reduced polio cases worldwide by 99%. However, Pakistan, alongside Afghanistan, remains a reservoir for the virus, impeded by challenges that are both logistical and political. Additional concerns arise as sporadic cases emerge in other regions due to virus importation, emphasizing global interdependence on this health issue.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Challenges:**
   - The research aims to address the difficulties in polio eradication within Pakistan, highlighting obstacles that compromise the right to health. It tackles human rights questions related to equitable access to vaccines and the protection of children from preventable diseases.

3. **Summary of Research Methods:**
   - The article examines historical vaccination data and evaluates trends in vaccine coverage over time in Pakistan. It also draws on case studies of recent outbreaks and analyzes cross-border virus transmission dynamics to understand eradication failures.

4. **Main Findings and Human Rights Violations:**
   - Despite a robust vaccination program starting in 1978, Pakistan saw a decline in coverage after 2007. Political instability, misinformation, and public distrust in vaccinations have inhibited polio eradication. These barriers effectively violate children's human rights to health and protection against preventable diseases.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   - The analysis suggests that while legal structures for immunization exist, implementation is inconsistent. The EPI faced setbacks due to inadequate governance, public policy missteps, and lackluster health infrastructure support.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - The authors conclude that without addressing fundamental issues of governance, misinformation, and public engagement, polio eradication will remain elusive in Pakistan. They recommend strengthening policy frameworks, enhancing community engagement programs, and international support for immunization initiatives.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   - Limitations include the impact of Pakistan’s political climate on data collection and public health efforts. Access to rural areas can be challenging due to security concerns, hindering accurate data acquisition. Moreover, sociopolitical resistance adds complexity to interpreting vaccination program efficacy.

The article underlines the critical need for coordinated global and national efforts to overcome the remaining barriers to polio eradication.","Poliomyelitis is an extremely disabling disease caused bythe polio virus, a virus belonging to Picornaviridae family.Humans are the only natural host. The virus principallyinvolves the motor neurons resulting in permanentasymmetrical lifelong paralysis. Effective vaccines areavailable for its eradication. Unfortunately despite vaccineavailability the disease cannot be eradicated from earth yet.Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two nationsharbouring the polio virus. Lately sporadic cases ofPoliomyelitis have also been reported from countries likeMozambique, which had an outbreak following importingof wild poliovirus (WPV1) from Pakistan.1 As long as a singlechild remains infected, children in all countries are at riskof contracting polio.2
Expanded Programme for Immunization (EPI) was initiatedin Pakistan in 1978. Polio vaccine was included along withfive other vaccines against life threatening diseases likeTuberculosis, Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, and Measles.The journey that took off smoothly with over 50% vaccinecoverage by 1990 raised to 80% coverage by 2007, hastaken a sharp dip in the ensuing decades. Pakistanunfortunately never recovered from the scourge of poliodisease. In 1988 Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI)was started, that resulted in a decline to 99% cases of polioin the world, but Pakistan continued to face challengeswhich has prevented total eradication of polio.3

Our aim is to describe the accuracy of diagnosis, and complications in a limited resources setting in children between 5 and 14 years old at the only tertiary referral hospital in the West region of Afghanistan.MethodsA retrospective study for a period of 1 year (21 March 2015–20 March 2016). Data was collected from patients' files. Data were analysed by epi info 7.ResultsWe identified 774 children who had appendectomies at Herat Regional Hospital during the study period with complete records available for analysis. The median age was 11 years [5–14]. The rate of positive appendectomy was 87%. 72% of appendectomies were done within 24 h of the onset of symptoms. Of 675 positive appendectomies, the most common clinical features were migratory abdominal pain (90%), nausea/vomiting (80%), RLQ tenderness (90%), and rebound tenderness (81%). Among the 99 negative appendectomies, the most common signs and symptoms were anorexia 68%, nausea/vomiting 59%, RLQ tenderness 79%, and rebound tenderness 43%. 98% of positive and 71% of negative appendectomies had elevated WBC count. Post appendectomy complications occurred in 9% of our patients mostly commonly intra‐abdominal abscesses (5%).ConclusionAlthough the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is challenging in children and may involve sophisticated imaging techniques, in many settings these are unavailable. Classical manifestations such as migratory abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, nausea, and simple lab tests play a crucial role in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in low resource environments."

                  Background and Hypothesis
                  Schizophrenia is a mental disorder usually presented in adulthood that affects roughly 0.3 percent of the population. The disease contributes to more than 13 million years lived with disability the global burden of disease. The current study aimed to provide new insights into the quality of care in Schizophrenia via the implementation of the newly introduced quality of care index (QCI) into the existing data.
               
               
                  Study Design
                  The data from the global burden of disease database was used for schizophrenia. Two secondary indices were calculated from the available indices and used in a principal component analysis to develop a proxy of QCI for each country. The QCI was then compared between different sociodemographic index (SDI) and ages. To assess the disparity in QCI between the sexes, the gender disparity ratio (GDR) was also calculated and analyzed in different ages and SDIs.
               
               
                  Study Results
                  The global QCI proxy score has improved between 1990 and 2019 by roughly 13.5%. Concerning the gender disparity, along with a rise in overall GDR the number of countries having a GDR score of around one has decreased which indicates an increase in gender disparity regarding quality of care of schizophrenia. Bhutan and Singapore had 2 of the highest QCIs in 2019 while also showing GDR scores close to one.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  While the overall conditions in the quality of care have improved, significant disparities and differences still exist between different countries, genders, and ages in the quality of care regarding schizophrenia.

Limited data exist on the disease's impact on quality of life in low‐resource settings. This case–control study aims to identify potential risk factors and assess the quality of life among hepatitis B patients in Herat, Afghanistan, with a focus on sex differences. Understanding these factors can inform prevention, care, and sex‐specific interventions. A cross‐sectional study conducted at Herat Regional Hospital examined hepatitis B patients above 18 years old, between October 2020 and February 2021. The control group consisted of age and sex‐matched individuals without a history of hepatitis B. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire covering socio‐demographic characteristics, signs and symptoms of hepatitis B, and the SF‐36 questionnaire for measuring the quality of life of study participants. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate General Linear Models, and logistic regression. We identified several potential risk factors for hepatitis B infection, including male sex, younger age groups, tobacco use, lower education levels, rural residence, family history, weak social networks, specific family structures and underlying chronic diseases (p &lt; .05). The study found that hepatitis B cases had significantly lower mean scores across all SF‐36 components, indicating an overall reduced quality of life (p &lt; .05). These differences were more pronounced in males, although females had lower scores in most components. Role limitations due to physical and emotional health were particularly affected. These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions, sex‐specific strategies, improved healthcare access and comprehensive policies. These findings can inform prevention efforts to improve the overall quality of life of people with hepatitis B in Afghanistan."

1. **Context**: Multimorbidity, the condition of living with two or more long-term health ailments, is a pressing issue, especially in LMICs where such conditions manifest at younger ages, impacting quality of life and leading to financial and healthcare system burdens.

2. **Purpose**: The research aims to create a COS for both prevention and treatment of multimorbidity tailored specifically to LMICs, recognizing the need due to differences in healthcare settings compared to high-income countries (HICs). This project addresses the issue of inconsistent outcome measures centered around researchers' interests rather than the needs of those with multimorbidity, particularly in LMIC settings.

3. **Methods**: The study employed a systematic review, qualitative interviews, and Delphi surveys followed by consensus meetings. Stakeholders involved included individuals living with multimorbidity, caregivers, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers. The Delphi method and consensus meetings facilitated inclusive and comprehensive discussions of essential outcomes.

4. **Findings**: The COS for LMICs consists of four outcomes each for prevention and treatment. Shared across both sets are outcomes related to adverse events and quality of life. The prevention-focused COS also includes the development of new comorbidities and health risk behavior, while the treatment-focused COS emphasizes adherence to treatment and out-of-pocket expenditure. Gaps in previous research COS, created without LMIC input, are addressed by this study.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: Although the study does not directly address policies or legal frameworks, it implies a need for better integration of research findings into health policy and practice in LMICs.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The study proposes that utilizing the developed COS in future trials will enhance the effectiveness of multimorbidity interventions in LMICs. It recommends further work on validated tools to capture key outcomes and stresses the importance of research into preventive interventions.

7. **Limitations**: Challenges noted include linguistic barriers limiting participation in English-only surveys, researcher-heavy stakeholder representation, and evolving COS development methods. The political climate and data gaps in LMICs also add complexity to multimorbidity research.

This study emphasizes the importance of defining outcomes that are relevant to LMICs for improved health interventions, recognizing socioeconomic and systemic challenges unique to these regions.","IntroductionThe burden of multimorbidity is recognised increasingly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), creating a strong emphasis on the need for effective evidence-based interventions. Core outcome sets (COS) appropriate for the study of multimorbidity in LMICs do not presently exist. These are required to standardise reporting and contribute to a consistent and cohesive evidence-base to inform policy and practice. We describe the development of two COS for intervention trials aimed at preventing and treating multimorbidity in adults in LMICs.MethodsTo generate a comprehensive list of relevant prevention and treatment outcomes, we conducted a systematic review and qualitative interviews with people with multimorbidity and their caregivers living in LMICs. We then used a modified two-round Delphi process to identify outcomes most important to four stakeholder groups (people with multimorbidity/caregivers, multimorbidity researchers, healthcare professionals and policymakers) with representation from 33 countries. Consensus meetings were used to reach agreement on the two final COS. Registration:https://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/1580.ResultsThe systematic review and qualitative interviews identified 24 outcomes for prevention and 49 for treatment of multimorbidity. An additional 12 prevention and 6 treatment outcomes were added from Delphi round 1. Delphi round 2 surveys were completed by 95 of 132 round 1 participants (72.0%) for prevention and 95 of 133 (71.4%) participants for treatment outcomes. Consensus meetings agreed four outcomes for the prevention COS: (1) adverse events, (2) development of new comorbidity, (3) health risk behaviour and (4) quality of life; and four for the treatment COS: (1) adherence to treatment, (2) adverse events, (3) out-of-pocket expenditure and (4) quality of life.ConclusionFollowing established guidelines, we developed two COS for trials of interventions for multimorbidity prevention and treatment, specific to adults in LMIC contexts. We recommend their inclusion in future trials to meaningfully advance the field of multimorbidity research in LMICs.PROSPERO registration numberCRD42020197293."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: 
   - Three years after the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan in August 2021, the nation has faced severe humanitarian challenges. This includes a significant refugee crisis, with over five million people leaving the country. The political climate under the Taliban has worsened, particularly women’s rights, with stringent restrictions such as banning girls' education past age 12.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: 
   - The article explores how the Taliban's regime has impacted researchers, particularly women, and their flight from Afghanistan. It sheds light on the human rights challenges related to freedom of education, expression, and safety.

3. **Research Methods Used**: 
   - Nature conducted interviews with Afghan refugee researchers and academicians who shared their personal experiences and observations. Interviews provided firsthand accounts of the challenges faced under Taliban rule.

4. **Main Findings**: 
   - The article highlights extensive human rights violations, including severe restrictions on women's education and professional opportunities, leading many to flee. It notes the discouragement of research critical of Taliban policies and the precarious situation of Afghan nationals holding Taliban passports. It emphasizes the lack of safety and professional opportunities for researchers remaining in Afghanistan.

5. **Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies**: 
   - The article implicitly critiques the Taliban's policy framework, which permits certain research but bans inquiry that conflicts with their ideology. The Taliban's control affects academic freedom and the pursuit of scientific research.

6. **Authors’ Conclusions and Recommendations**: 
   - The authors conclude that while some scholars have found refuge and support abroad, their future remains uncertain. There is an expressed hope for improved conditions and possible return in the future. The scholars advocate for international support and opportunities for Afghan researchers displaced by the regime.

7. **Limitations of the Study**:
   - The study's insights are based on interviews with refugee researchers, which may not fully represent other sectors affected by the Taliban's rule. Limitations include challenges related to the political climate and the risks faced by those speaking out, impacting data comprehensiveness and the ability to freely conduct and publish research within Afghanistan. Additionally, the sensitive nature of addressing human rights under Taliban rule poses significant risks to both researchers and participants.",No abstract available

Shayan",https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.2301,2024-8-20,['Herat University'],Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"AbstractBackground and AimsGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a highly prevalent gastrointestinal disorder with modifiable risk factors that are associated with considerable health and economic burdens. The current study was conducted to assess the signs and symptoms, food behaviors, depression, anxiety, and stress related to GERD in Herat, Afghanistan.MethodsA descriptive study was conducted between August 29 and October 20, 2020, among patients with GERD symptoms, who provided informed verbal consent at the Mowaffaq Clinic and Sehat Hospital in Herat, Afghanistan. The minimum sample size was 384. Data were collected using a three‐domain questionnaire and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 42 standard questionnaire. SPSS version 27 was used to perform descriptive statistics and χ2 tests.ResultsThe sample consisted of 396 patients, with the majority being female (67.9%), married (78.5%), and illiterate (34.8%). Heartburn (88.1%) and regurgitation (84.3%) were the most common symptoms reported by participants. Tomato consumption (60.1%) was the most frequent type of eating behavior. Most patients reported severe anxiety (45.9%) and showed statistically significant differences in age, sex, education level, and cigarette usage. This study also found that certain demographic status, eating behaviors, and symptoms were associated with significantly different depression, anxiety, and stress scores among patients with GERD.ConclusionOur study demonstrates the association between GERD and various modifiable risk factors in Herat, Afghanistan. Public health initiatives focusing on preventive measures and raising awareness can potentially alleviate the burden of GERD. Moreover, further research and targeted interventions are essential to improve health outcomes, particularly among patients with GERD, who may experience psychological comorbidities."

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   The article delves into the experiences of refugee women resettled in the United States, exploring cultural preferences and the support mechanisms available to them. The historical context is grounded in the refugee crisis originating from countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, where ongoing conflict and political instability have necessitated resettlement.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Challenges:**
   The research aims to understand the cultural norms and practices surrounding healthcare and social support networks for refugee women. It addresses human rights challenges such as autonomy in healthcare decisions, accessibility to health services, and the right to adequate social support.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study utilizes qualitative interviews with refugee women to gather insights into their cultural preferences for healthcare providers, their perceptions of family planning, and the types of social support they receive upon resettlement in the United States.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - **Preference for Female Healthcare Providers:** Almost all interviewed women preferred female healthcare providers, often facilitated without explicit requests, acknowledging cultural sensitivities.
   - **Cultural Norms on Family Planning:** While many women accepted birth control culturally, decision-making was often influenced by male family members and elders.
   - **Social Support and Network:** Refugee women heavily depended on support from resettlement agencies, family, friends, and children to navigate daily life and healthcare needs. The quality and extent of this support varied widely.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   The article implicitly critiques the inadequacies in support systems by highlighting the inconsistent provision of services and information, which suggests a lack of standardized legal frameworks or policies to ensure consistent resettlement and integration support.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that while initial support from refugee resettlement agencies is crucial, the inconsistency in services and inadequate orientation could hamper successful integration. They recommend better training and increased staffing for caseworkers, along with more comprehensive orientation for refugees regarding their rights and available resources.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The study is limited by its reliance on qualitative data, which may reflect individual biases. Additionally, the inconsistent practices among resettlement agencies highlight possible gaps in federal or organizational policies that standardize support for refugees, compounded by potential political sensitivities and resource constraints in the host country.","Although a large number of Muslim refugees have resettled in the United States for the last decades, few studies have looked into maternal healthcare access and utilization among Muslim refugee women in the country. This qualitative study was conducted to explore the factors influencing maternal healthcare access and utilization among Muslim refugee women resettled in the United States. In-depth interviews were conducted among Afghan, Iraqi, and Syrian refugee women (n = 17) using an interview guide informed by Social Cognitive Theory and its key constructs. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, imported into MAXQDA 2020 (VERBI Software), and analyzed based on qualitative content analysis. Data analysis revealed several themes at the micro, meso, and macro-levels. Micro-level factors included women’s attitudes toward hospitals and prenatal care, as well as their life skills and language proficiency. Meso-level factors, such as cultural norms and practices, social support and network, as well as health care provider characteristics, were also identified. Macro-level factors, such as the complex healthcare system and access to insurance, also appeared to influence maternal healthcare access and utilization. This study revealed the complex contextual factors that refugee populations face. Given the population’s heterogeneity, a more nuanced understanding of refugee maternal health is required, as are more tailored programs for the most vulnerable groups of refugee women."

The research population consisted of families with malnourished children under 5 who were referred to Herat Children's Hospital. Data was collected using a comprehensive standard World Health Organization questionnaire to gather demographic information from children in Herat. A carefully selected convenience sampling method was used, with 300 referring patients participating in face‐to‐face interviews with the supervisors of these children. After obtaining personal consent and coordinating with health officials, interviews were conducted with the caregivers of children under 5 who suffered from severe malnutrition. The data was then analyzed using robust descriptive statistics, quantitative variables, mean and standard deviation, frequency, and relative frequency. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the factors that most influenced direct payments from patients' pockets, ensuring the reliability and validity of the findings.ResultsThe results showed that OOPE in both households with seven and less than seven people and more than seven people was 68%. The findings indicated that among the residents of Herat referred to the studied hospital, these people spent 54% of the treatment costs directly out of pocket. In contrast, people in the rural areas of Herat pay 69% of the treatment costs to receive medical services straight out of pocket. The critical point is that 93% of the families have incurred catastrophic expenses to treat their children suffering from severe malnutrition. The research revealed that the patient's location and the education level of the head of the household were the most significant factors affecting out‐of‐pocket payments by patients.ConclusionIncreasing OOPE in rural Afghanistan poses a significant obstacle to equitable healthcare services and access to appropriate medicines. To support the goal of universal healthcare coverage, geographic imbalances, and broad health financing options must be addressed. Strengthening insurance coverage and more government assistance can significantly reduce these patients' out‐of‐pocket payments."
The “First daughter” effect: Human rights advocacy and attitudes toward gender equality in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan,"Kristina Becvar, Charli Carpenter, Bernhard Leidner, Kevin L. Young",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0298812,2024-7-17,['University of Massachusetts Amherst'],Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Governance']","['Gender', 'Civil Society']",,"**Summary of the Article:**

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   Since the Taliban regained power in Afghanistan in fall 2021, there has been significant international concern about the human rights of Afghan women. The Taliban’s control has been associated with numerous human rights violations against women, including restrictions on education and employment. The international community faces challenges in effectively advocating for women's rights under these conditions, needing to balance international pressure and the potential for backlash.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges:**
   The research aims to investigate Afghan internet users’ attitudes towards gender equality and human rights, focusing on the support for women's rights in Afghanistan. The study addresses the challenge of understanding which demographics within Afghanistan might be effective advocates for women's rights, especially in a context of severe gender inequality.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The researchers conducted a random survey of Afghan internet users using RIWI's Random Domain Intercept Technology (RDIT) to collect data on attitudes towards peace, security, gender equality, and human rights. The study included an embedded survey experiment to test the ""first-daughter effect,"" assessing whether fathers with eldest daughters are more likely to support women's rights when primed to think about the gender of their eldest child.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The study found significant support for women’s rights in Afghanistan, with 66% agreeing that achieving human rights for women should be a priority. Importantly, fathers of eldest daughters showed increased support for women’s rights when primed to consider the gender of their eldest child. This suggests that advocacy efforts should consider targeting fathers of eldest daughters as potential allies.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   The article did not specifically focus on the legal frameworks or policies related to human rights in Afghanistan but rather on societal attitudes and the potential for strategic advocacy.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that priming men to think about their eldest daughters can positively affect their attitudes towards women's rights. They recommend that human rights organizations target fathers of eldest daughters through imagery and advocacy strategies that highlight father-daughter relationships to improve women’s rights advocacy in Afghanistan.

7. **Limitations:**
   The study is limited to internet users, who may not represent the entire Afghan population. The security situation and political climate in Afghanistan also impose limitations on data collection. The findings may not fully represent the views of those without internet access or those fearful of expressing their opinions.","International concern for the human rights of Afghan women has spiked since the Taliban consolidated power in Afghanistan in fall 2021. Yet little is known about how to effectively advocate for women’s human rights under this new context. We present findings from a random sample of all adult Afghan internet users’ attitudes toward peace, security, gender, and human rights and find significant support for women’s human rights as a national priority within Afghanistan, even when controlling for other priorities and even among many men and women aligned with the Taliban. Given that men now have much more political power in Afghan society to protect women’s rights, we paid particular attention to men’s attitudes toward women’s human rights. Our evidence from an embedded survey experiment, building on earlier literature from other countries, demonstrates that fathers of eldest daughters are particularly likely to favor prioritizing women’s rights when primed to think about the gender of their eldest children. Thus, the human rights and humanitarian community should spend more time and attention engaging with this demographic, and specifically creating marketing and advocacy strategies that encourage men to think about or act on behalf of their eldest daughters."
A qualitative study on the challenges of Afghan child labourers in Tehran,"Arash Ziapour, Fakhreddin Chaboksavar, Ahmad Ahmadi, Javad Yoosefi Lebni, Neda Kianipour, Parisa Janjani, Nafiul Mehedi",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0306318,2024-7-12,"['Cardiovascular Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences']",Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Education', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Child Labour', ""Refugees' Rights"", 'Disease Prevention', 'Mental Health', 'School Access', 'Educational Limitations']",,"**Summary of the Article:**

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   Since the 1980s, Afghanistan has experienced ongoing political instability, leading many Afghans to seek refuge in Iran. Tehran hosts a significant Afghan refugee population, with estimates suggesting nearly three million Afghans, both formal and informal residents. Child labor among Afghan refugees in Tehran is part of the broader global phenomenon of child labor fueled by socio-economic factors such as poverty and unemployment.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Focus:**
   This study explores the distinct challenges Afghan child laborers face in Tehran, focusing on psychological, health, and social challenges. The research addresses the human rights issues of child labor, especially for refugees, who may be deprived of basic rights and subject to abuse.

3. **Research Methods:**
   Conducted in 2022 using a qualitative approach, the study involved semi-structured interviews with 25 Afghan child laborers in Tehran. Participants were selected through purposive and snowball sampling, and data was analyzed using Granheim and Lundman’s method.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The research identified key challenges for Afghan child laborers under three main categories: psychological (e.g., harassment, abuse, negative emotions), health (e.g., physical injuries, lack of medical care), and social (e.g., educational limitations and social isolation). These children face multifaceted human rights violations, exacerbated by their refugee status and lack of governmental support.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   The study highlights the lack of adequate legal support and social services for Afghan child laborers in Iran, often due to their undocumented status. Institutional neglect and societal discrimination exacerbate their vulnerability.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude by advocating for targeted interventions at both the individual and societal levels. Recommendations include improving healthcare access, education, and social integration for Afghan child laborers, alongside training workshops on health and safety. Legal protections and societal acceptance must also be strengthened.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The study's main limitations include the sensitivity of refugee issues, potential bias due to participants' fear of authority, and restricted data sharing to protect participant privacy. These factors, coupled with Iran's complex political climate, may influence the completeness and accuracy of information gathered.","Afghan refugees child labourers face many challenges as they are labelled as refugees. In an attempt to explore these challenges, the present study was conducted in Tehran with a qualitative approach. The present qualitative research was conducted using a conventional content analysis approach with 25 Afghan child labourers in 2022 in Tehran. Child labourers were selected through purposive and snowball sampling and interviewed in a semi-in-depth interview. The data were analysed based on Granheim and Lundman’s criteria, as well as those of Guba and Lincoln, to further enrich the findings. A total of 3 categories, 13 sub-categories, and 183 initial codes were extracted from the data analysis, including: ""psychological challenges"" (history of harassment and abuse, negative effects, high-risk behaviours, and family detachment); ""health challenges"" (physical problems, inappropriate accommodation, medical/therapeutic problems, and health threats); and ""social challenges"" (neglected childhood, dual identity, educational limitations, inadequate social support, social isolation, and social humiliation). At the individual level, it is possible to meet the child labourers’ health needs and make them aware of the hazards of working in the streets through physical examination at certain intervals and holding training workshops on harassment prevention, anger control, prevention of high-risk behaviours, prevention of infectious diseases such as hepatitis, and strengthening self-confidence to improve health. Also, the Afghan child labourers’ work could be intervened at the social and familial level by providing accommodation in more suitable neighbourhoods, providing health insurance for child labourers, creating the chances of studying in schools, preventing dropouts, and strengthening social relations in order to improve children’s health."
Infant and child mortality in Afghanistan: A scoping review,"Khulud Qamar, Mohammad Yasir Essar, Javeria Arif Siddiqui, Ariba Salman, Yumna Salman, Michael G. Head",https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.2224,2024-7-10,['Dow Medical College Pakistan'],Review,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"AbstractBackground and AimsSince 1990, global child and infant mortality rates have typically stabilized or decreased due to improved healthcare, vaccination rollouts, and international funding. However, Afghanistan continues to face the highest child and infant mortality rates globally, with 43 deaths per 1000 live births. This study aims to examine the factors contributing to this high mortality rate and propose interventions to address the issue.MethodsA comprehensive literature search was conducted using databases such as Google Scholar and PubMed, focusing on articles published in English within the last 10 years (2013–2023). The search terms included “Child mortality,” “Infant mortality,” “SIDS,” “COVID‐19,” and “Afghanistan.” Original studies, systematic reviews, case studies, and reports meeting the inclusion criteria were selected for analysis. Additional sources from organizations such as UNICEF, the World Bank Group, WHO, and EMRO were also reviewed.ResultsThe study findings reveal significant challenges contributing to Afghanistan's high infant and child mortality rates. These challenges include birth defects, preterm birth, malnutrition, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), traumatic injuries, fatal infections, infanticide, and abuse. The ongoing conflict, insecurity, and humanitarian crises further exacerbate the situation, leading to increased child casualties. Despite efforts by international agencies like UNICEF to provide vaccines and maternal education, the infant mortality rate remains high.ConclusionIn conclusion, Afghanistan's child and infant mortality rates are of significant concern, and it is imperative that action be taken to reduce the incidence of child and infant mortality rates."
The individual- and community-level women’s empowerment and utilization of maternity care services in Afghanistan: a multilevel cross-validation study,Omid Dadras,https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihad116,2023-12-21,"['Haukeland Universitetssjukehus', 'Universitetet i Bergen']",Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"Abstract
               
                  Background
                  This study aimed to explore the relationship between women's empowerment and utilization of maternity care for married Afghan women aged 15–49 y in Afghanistan, assessing the convergence validity of the Survey-based Women's Empowerment Index in Afghanistan (SWEI-A).
               
               
                  Methods
                  The study used data from the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic Health Survey to examine the association of different domains of women's empowerment with the utilization of maternity care using multilevel Poisson regression at both individual and community levels.
               
               
                  Results
                  The utilization of maternity services was considerably higher among women with high scores compared with those with low scores in almost all domains of the SWEI-A, except for property owning, in which women with high scores appeared to have lower rates of utilization of such services compared with those with low scores. At the community level, those communities with high participation of women in the labor force were less likely to have adequate antenatal care (ANC), institutional delivery and postnatal care (PNC). Individual-level literacy was associated with higher utilization of ANC, institutional delivery and PNC, contrary to community-level literacy.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Except for property owning, the high score in almost all other domains was associated with higher utilization of maternity care, which indicates an acceptable level of convergence validity for the developed index (i.e. the SWEI-A) in measuring women's empowerment among married Afghan women aged 15–49 y.

The refugee children originated from three countries: Iraq (n = 304), Syria (n = 101) and Afghanistan (n = 43). The data were analysed using the SPSS data analysis program. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Düzce Üniversity.ResultsThe results suggest that refugee and asylum‐seeker children have significantly higher rates of acute illness or infection, malnutrition (p &lt; 0.001) and anaemia (p &lt; 0.001) than local children as a result of living in overcrowded families (p = 0.017) and unhealthy conditions. Adolescent pregnancy (p = 0.049) emerges as an important social problem as a result of child marriage among refugee children, mostly in the form of consanguineous marriages (p &lt; 0.001). The rate of having at least two adolescent pregnancies (under 18) was highest among Syrian refugee girls (p = 0.01). Although refugee and asylum‐seeker children have higher rates of health insurance (between 74% and 95%), they have lower rates of insurance compared to local children. This research also compares the data from three nationalities, including Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq children; Iraqi and Afghan children under the international protection (IP) system with limited social support and rights had worse health conditions compared to other groups. Although Iraqi children had the highest rates of health insurance on admission (p &lt; 0.001), they also had higher rates of chronic diseases (p = 0.001), infections (p = 0.004), allergic rhinitis (p = 0.001) and malnutrition (p &lt; 0.001). The youngest age of admission (p = 0.006) and the shortest length of stay (p = 0.004) were for Afghan children who also had higher rates of upper respiratory infections (p = 0.021).ConclusionsThis study highlights the urgent need for improved screening programmes and the importance of collaborative efforts to address the specific health needs of these populations. Addressing the health status of child refugees is a complex and multifaceted task that requires the active participation of healthcare professionals, policymakers and researchers, each of whom has a crucial role to play."

Perspectives of refugee parents and unaccompanied minors on initial health assessment and access to care,"Albertine Baauw, Chanine F. S. Brouwers, Sogol Fathi Afshar, Johannes B. van Goudoever, Mai J. M. Chinapaw, Mariëtte H. H. Hoogsteder",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-024-05523-5,2024-4-9,"['Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam', 'Universiteit van Amsterdam', 'Dutch Society of Global Health and Tropical Medicine']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Nutrition', 'Disease Prevention', 'Migration', 'Mental Health and Psychosocial Support']",,"The article provides insights into the healthcare experiences of asylum-seeking parents and unaccompanied minors in the Netherlands. Below is a summary addressing the requested points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The study is set against the backdrop of the ongoing global refugee crisis, focusing on asylum seekers in the Netherlands, primarily from Syria, Eritrea, and Afghanistan. These individuals often flee war and persecution, facing complex challenges upon arrival in host countries like the Netherlands.

2. **Purpose of Research and Human Rights Issues**: The research aims to explore health care experiences and systemic challenges faced by asylum seekers in the Netherlands, particularly addressing health-related human rights. It examines the adequacy of initial health assessments, mental health needs, and cultural integration stressors that infringe upon their right to appropriate health care and social support.

3. **Research Methods**: The study involved focus group discussions (FGDs) with 31 participants (parents and unaccompanied minors) and interviews with six healthcare professionals. The FGDs and interviews explored experiences and perceptions related to health assessments and access to healthcare services.

4. **Main Findings**: 
   - Initial health assessments were generally misunderstood, with the exception of vaccinations.
   - Significant mental health issues and psychosocial problems were identified, yet these needs often remained unmet.
   - Participants faced challenges navigating the Dutch healthcare system, with language barriers and cultural differences contributing to the difficulties in accessing care.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The study indirectly addresses the Netherlands' health policies for asylum seekers, noting systemic barriers like delayed treatments and complex referrals that undermine asylum seekers' access to care. It highlights a misalignment between asylum seekers' expectations and the healthcare system's provisions.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that there are significant gaps in healthcare delivery for refugees, which can be mitigated by enhancing cultural competency and communication within the healthcare system. Recommendations include the provision of professional interpreters, better information dissemination about the Dutch healthcare system, and more comprehensive mental health support.

7. **Limitations**: The study's limitations stem from potential biases in self-reported data, a relatively small sample size, and the socio-political sensitivity of refugee issues that might affect participant openness. The complexity of the Dutch asylum system also poses challenges in generalizing findings to all asylum seekers.","AbstractTo explore the needs, expectations, and experiences of asylum-seeking parents and unaccompanied minors under the age of 18 years on the initial health assessment for children and adolescents and access to care upon entry in the Netherlands, We conducted five semi-structured focus group discussions with asylum-seeking parents and unaccompanied minors, from Syria, Eritrea, Afghanistan, and other Middle-East and African countries, supported by professional interpreters. To triangulate findings, semi-structured interviews with health care professionals involved in care for refugee children were conducted. Transcripts of focus group discussions were inductively and deductively coded and content analyzed; transcripts of interviews were deductively coded and content analyzed. In total, 31 asylum-seeking participants: 23 parents of 101 children (between 0 and 18 years old), 8 unaccompanied minors (between 15 and 17 years), and 6 healthcare professionals participated. Parents and minors expressed that upon entry, their needs were met for vaccinations, but not for screening or care for physical and mental health problems. Parents, minors, and health professionals emphasized the necessity of appropriate information and education about health, diseases, and the health system. Cultural change was mentioned as stressful for the parent–child interaction and parental well-being.     Conclusion: The perspectives of refugee parents and unaccompanied minors revealed opportunities to improve the experience of and access to health care of refugees entering the Netherlands, especially risk-specific screening and more adequate education about health, diseases, and the Dutch health care system.

                    
                      What is Known:•  Refugees have specific health needs due to pre-flight, flight, and resettlement conditions. Health assessment upon entry was non-obligatory in the Netherlands, except for the tuberculosis screening. Health needs were not always met, and refugees experienced barriers in access to care.
                    
                    
                      What is New:• The initial health assessment met the needs concerning vaccinations but mismatched the needs regarding physical and mental health assessment. Screening for specific risk-related diseases and mental health could enable refugee parents and minors to engage better with the health system.

Insecurity and Support for Female Leadership in Conflict States: Evidence from Afghanistan,"Jasmine Bhatia, Steve L. Monroe",https://doi.org/10.1017/S000712342300056X,2023-12-15,"['Birkbeck, University of London']",Article,1,Yes,"['Security and Conflict', 'Human Rights']","['Gender', 'Peace Initiatives', 'Military Actions']",,"The article discusses an examination of public attitudes towards female political leadership in conflict states, particularly Afghanistan, focusing on how insecurity influences these attitudes. Here is a summary addressing the outlined points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: From 2001 to 2021, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (IRoA) saw advancements in women's political representation. This period followed the US and allies' intervention in Afghanistan, which displaced the Taliban, who had previously barred women from politics. Despite these gains, Afghanistan remained plagued by insecurity, with ongoing Taliban insurgency and other forms of violence, posing challenges to women's political inclusion.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research aimed to explore how insecurity affects public support for female political leadership in conflict states, where women's political inclusion is an axis of contention. It addresses whether insecurity weakens or enhances support for female leadership by examining societal attitudes and gender biases.

3. **Research Methods**: The study used a survey experiment conducted in three Afghan provinces between 2016 and 2017. Respondents were primed with information about Afghanistan's worsening security situation and participated in a conjoint exercise to assess preferences for leadership profiles, including gender. Observational data from the Asia Foundation's Survey of the Afghan People also supplemented the analysis.

4. **Main Findings**: The insecurity prime notably reduced support for female leadership among women but not men, indicating that women's preferences are more vulnerable to perceptions of insecurity. Observational data revealed polarized attitudes towards female leadership, both in men and women, in the context of insecurity. Contrary to experimental expectations, in some provinces, insecurity correlated with increased support for female leadership.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The study did not provide an explicit examination of Afghanistan's legal frameworks related to human rights but noted Afghanistan's gender quotas and international efforts supporting women's political inclusion.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors concluded that insecurity's impact on support for female leadership is heterogeneous and context-specific. They highlighted the interplay between gender, insecurity, and support for traditional governance structures, suggesting further research on these dynamics in other conflict states like Iraq, Nigeria, and Syria.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study faced challenges due to social desirability biases, difficulty in isolating insecurity effects, and differences between experimentally observed and observed attitudes. Additionally, the political climate and sensitivity of discussing women's rights posed challenges in obtaining accurate data, with regional variations complicating the analysis.

Overall, the study advances understanding of the complex relationship between insecurity and public attitudes towards female leaders in conflict states, highlighting both challenges and opportunities for women's political inclusion amidst ongoing security issues.","AbstractWhile women's political inclusion is central to international conflict resolution efforts, public attitudes in conflict states towards women's political inclusion remain understudied. We expect insecurity to depress support for female political leadership in conflicts where women's political inclusion is violently contested. Citizens wanting security through force prefer male leaders because of stereotypes privileging men's military prowess. However, citizens wanting security through reconciliation also favour men for fear that female leadership would provoke more violence. We assess these expectations with experimental and observational data from the former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. In the survey experiment, priming respondents to think about insecurity decreases support for female leadership, but only among women. In observational data, insecurity correlates with more polarized attitudes towards women's political representation in some regions and greater support for female leaders in others. Insecurity's impact on public support for female leadership in conflict states may be highly heterogeneous."

Improving healthcare education, boosting confidence in appropriate healthcare use, and utilisation of electronic consultations effectively.MethodWorking with the local authorities, primary care services were brought to the hotel. Regular 3-hour drop-in sessions with a health and wellbeing coach were established and attended by residents. Non-identifiable data was recorded in individual patient care records and summarised quantitatively.  Qualitative data was collected via a pre-established questionnaire during the sessions.  ResultsIdentified issues included language barriers, mental health problems, infectious diseases, contraception, and healthcare access. Language barriers were addressed with interpreters. Fifty-nine patients accessed support services, with 13 benefiting from e-consultations, and nine requiring on-site medical consultations in a 3-month period. Mental health support and infectious disease referrals were facilitated. Access challenges were mitigated by transitioning to e-consultations or face-to-face appointments. Outcomes included improved patient independence, awareness of healthcare processes, familiarity with LWP services, and confidence in navigating the NHS.ConclusionA multifaceted approach is vital for addressing language and access barriers for refugees.

Frequency of Psychological Stress and Barriers to Accessing Mental Health Services for Leipzig Citizens of Afghan and Iraqi Citizenship,"Klara Koch, Yuriy Nesterko, Kim Hella Schönenberg, Heide Glaesmer",https://doi.org/10.1055/a-2311-4717,2024-6-12,['Universität Leipzig'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"Zusammenfassung
          Ziel der Studie Ziel der Studie war das Inanspruchnahmeverhalten von
                    Versorgungsangeboten im Bereich psychischer Gesundheit in Leipzig durch
                    Iraker*innen und Afghan*innen bei Vorliegen psychischer Belastungen zu
                    untersuchen und vor allem Zugangshürden in der Versorgung zu identifizieren.
          Methodik Alle volljährigen, in Leipzig lebenden Personen mit irakischer
                    oder afghanischer Staatsangehörigkeit, die nicht in Deutschland geboren waren,
                    wurden kontaktiert. Es wurden verschiedene Instrumente (PHQ-9, GAD-7, SSS-8,
                    PCL-5/LEC-5) zur objektiven Erfassung psychischer Belastungen und ein Item zur
                    Erfassung subjektiver psychischer Belastung genutzt. Lag ein Behandlungsbedarf
                    vor, wurde die Inanspruchnahme von psychosozialen Versorgungsangeboten erfragt.
                    Wenn trotz des nachgewiesenen Bedarfs Hilfsangebote nicht in Anspruch genommen
                    worden waren, wurden mögliche Hürden erfragt.
          Ergebnisse 51.4% der befragten Personen zeigten subjektiven und objektiven
                    Behandlungsbedarf, 38.2% dieser Personen mit Behandlungsbedarf nahmen keine
                    Hilfe in Anspruch. Häufige Gründe dafür waren, das Problem allein lösen zu
                    wollen oder das Problem nicht als sehr störend zu empfinden. Außerdem wurden
                    mangelndes Vertrauen in das Gesundheitssystem, sowie Angst vor Diskriminierung
                    und Stigmatisierung als Hürden benannt.
          Diskussion Die Studie zeigt einen hohen Behandlungsbedarf in den
                    untersuchten Gruppen. Dies könnte auf die hohe Anzahl an traumatischen
                    Ereignissen, sowie Postmigrationsstressoren zurückzuführen sein. Mehr als die
                    Hälfte der Personen haben Hilfsangebote in Anspruch genommen. Eine längere
                    Aufenthaltsdauer in Deutschland und der durch die Krankenversicherungskarte
                    vereinfachte Zugang zum öffentlichen Gesundheitssystem könnten die
                    Inanspruchnahme gefördert haben. Hürden wie mangelndes Wissen und Vertrauen in
                    Bezug auf das deutsche Gesundheitssystem oder Angst vor Stigmatisierung und
                    Diskriminierung erschweren den Zugang zu Versorgung.
          Schlussfolgerung Es sollten mehr Informationen über Versorgungsstrukturen
                    verbreitet, sowie mehr niedrigschwellige Angebote implementiert werden. Diese
                    sollten interdisziplinär organisiert sein und den Fokus auf eine kultur- und
                    rassismussensible Betreuung legen. Sie dürfen vor allem im Hinblick auf den
                    hohen Bedarf an psychosozialer Hilfe keinesfalls weiter beschränkt werden."

A qualitative interview study in three Afghan provinces,"Anjuli Kaul, Lamba Saboor, Ayesha Ahmad, Jenevieve Mannell, Sharli Anne Paphitis, Delan Devakumar",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2023-079615,2024-6-5,"[""King's College London""]",Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Gender', 'Gender Apartheid', 'Maternal Health']",,"The article discusses a study conducted in Afghanistan focused on domestic violence against women (DVA) and the psychological impacts on female survivors. Here is a summary covering the requested points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The study was conducted prior to the Taliban's accession to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Afghanistan has a history of prolonged armed conflict, which has exacerbated violence against women (VAW) and led to widespread mental health issues, especially among female survivors of domestic violence and abuse (DVA).

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Issues:**
   The research aimed to develop recommendations to enhance mental health support for female survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) in Afghanistan. It addresses the challenge of limited mental health services amidst social stigmas and restrictions on women's freedoms, seeking to understand the individual and community-level experiences of violence among Afghan women.

3. **Methods:**
   The study used semistructured interviews and focus group discussions conducted in three diverse Afghan regions (Kabul, Bamyan, and Nangarhar) with female survivors, male community members, and service providers. Thematic analysis was employed to identify patterns and themes from the interviews, conducted in local languages with informed consent.

4. **Main Findings:**
   There is a severe lack of mental health services in Afghanistan, with existing services struggling to meet demand. Cultural stigmas and gender norms significantly hinder women's access to care and support. The study identified various forms of violence women endure, including physical abuse, sexual violence, and forced labor, often exacerbated by social norms and familial pressures.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Institutions:**
   The study highlights the systemic deficiencies in legal and institutional support for women. Under Taliban rule, restrictions on NGOs and women's rights have worsened the situation, limiting women's access to necessary services.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors recommend improving mental health support through culturally appropriate interventions, capacity building for mental health professionals, and advocating for societal change to reduce stigma around mental health and violence. They suggest exploring telehealth as a low-cost solution and emphasize the need for family-focused interventions.

7. **Study Limitations:**
   The study's data were collected before the Taliban regained control, and the rapidly changing political environment poses challenges to implementing recommendations. Additionally, the study only included women who had already left their abusive environments, which might not reflect the needs of those still living under such conditions.

Overall, the study sheds light on the multifaceted challenges faced by Afghan women who experience DVA, highlighting a critical need for structured mental health support amidst cultural and political barriers.","ObjectivesThis study aimed to qualitatively explore (1) the experiences of female survivors of domestic abuse and mental health problems in Afghanistan; (2) how female survivors of violence and abuse, male members of the community and service providers perceive and respond to mental health and domestic violence in Afghanistan and (3) the provision of mental health services for female survivors of violence and abuse in Afghanistan, including the barriers and challenges faced around accessing mental health services.DesignQualitative interviews and framework thematic analysis.SettingKabul, Bamyan and Nangarhar in Afghanistan.Participants60 female survivors of domestic abuse, 60 male community members and 30 service providers who work with female survivors of domestic abuse.ResultsExperiences of multiple and compounding traumatic experiences of violence, armed conflict, and complex and competing psychosocial concerns were common among the female survivor participants. All female survivor participants reported experiencing negative mental health outcomes in relation to their experiences of violence and abuse, which were further precipitated by widespread social stigma and gender norms. Support and service provision for female survivors was deemed by participants to be insufficient in comparison to the amount of people who need to access them.ConclusionsThere are many risks and barriers women face to disclosing their experiences of violence and mental health problems which restrict women’s access to psychological support. Culturally relevant services and trauma-informed interventions are necessary to respond to these issues. Service providers should be trained to effectively recognise and respond to survivors’ mental health needs."
Rewriting Internal Relocation from a Refugee Perspective - The Lived Experience of Refugees in Afghanistan,"Sitarah Mohammadi, Maria O’Sullivan",https://doi.org/10.1093/rsq/hdad024,2024-9-5,['Monash University'],Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"ABSTRACT
               This article is part of a broader project aimed at rewriting refugee law jurisprudence from a lived refugee perspective. The co-authors, one of whom is a refugee from Afghanistan, have chosen internal relocation as the subject of this project as it is a problematic and controversial principle of international refugee law which we believe is frequently applied without due consideration of the practical experience of refugees.
               Internal relocation provides that a refugee may be returned to their country of origin if they can relocate to a “safe” part of that state where they would not have a well-founded fear of persecution. This principle is somewhat tempered by the application of a “reasonableness” test in most jurisdictions. That test aims to reflect that, in some cases, it may not be possible to require a refugee to relocate to another part of their country of origin to avoid persecution. However, a “reasonableness” factor is not always considered as part of relocation. Moreover, it aims to bring an “objective” standard of reasonableness, which can be critiqued on a number of bases.
               In this article, the authors rewrite an Australian Refugee Review Tribunal decision dealing with an applicant from Afghanistan to reflect the lived experience of refugees better and to encourage readers to think about whether some of the assumptions made in internal relocation jurisprudence have been fully interrogated. Much of internal relocation scholarship focuses on conceptual legal issues, for instance, whether relocation is grounded in the text, context or object of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and whether relocation fits within the “well-founded fear” or “state protection” limb of the refugee definition. While these are important conceptual debates about the treaty basis for internal relocation, we believe these have been well-analysed in the existing literature. Our article seeks to add to these core debates by reconceptualising the application of relocation to authentic refugee experiences and, through this, to highlight some of the weaknesses in the current approach to this complex question."
Protection of internally displaced people in South Asia: the role the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could play in implementing a convention similar to the Kampala Convention,"Harsh Mahaseth, Utkarshani Srivastava, Niharika Goel",https://doi.org/10.4337/apjel.2024.01.05,,['O.P.

Continuum of maternal and new-natal health care: empirical evidence from 10 developing countries in South and South East Asia,"Dil Bahadur Rahut, Anjali Singh, Tetsushi Sonobe",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12546-024-09327-0,2024-5-6,['Asian Development Bank Institute'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Economy and Infrastructure']","['Maternal Health', 'Socio-Economic Development']",,"The article presents a comprehensive analysis of the continuum of care (CoC) in maternal and neonatal health (MNH) services across ten South and Southeast Asian countries, focusing on the socio-economic and demographic characteristics that influence the use of these services.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The study is situated in the context of South and Southeast Asian countries, regions known for varying levels of healthcare access and socio-economic disparities. This regional focus highlights long-standing public health challenges and the efforts to improve maternal and child health as a critical component of national health agendas.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The study aims to evaluate the utilization of maternal and neonatal healthcare services and identify factors affecting the continuum of care from pregnancy to postnatal stages. It addresses human rights challenges related to healthcare accessibility and equity, focusing on disparities due to socio-economic status, education, media exposure, and geographical location.

3. **Research Methods**: The research utilizes pooled data from demographic and household surveys conducted between 2014 and 2021. It employs bivariate and multivariate analyses, including binary logistic regression and Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition, to assess associations between various socio-demographic factors and the uptake of MNH services.

4. **Main Findings**: The study highlights significant disparities in access to the full continuum of care, with urban women, those with higher education, and those from wealthier households more likely to receive comprehensive MNH services. The greatest dropouts in care occur during the ANC stage. Afghanistan, Timor-Leste, and Bangladesh have the lowest prevalence of women receiving all three critical MNH services, while Indonesia, Cambodia, Maldives, and the Philippines perform better.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The study does not explicitly examine the legal frameworks but indirectly addresses the effectiveness of healthcare systems and policies by identifying barriers to service access.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that increasing education levels, media exposure, wealth, and access to healthcare facilities are crucial in improving CoC uptake. They recommend targeted interventions to reduce socio-economic and geographical disparities and enhance early ANC visits.

7. **Limitations**: The study's limitations include potential biases in self-reported data and the absence of qualitative insights into systemic barriers. Political climates and socio-economic inequalities in the region may also affect data collection and the study's scope. Additionally, the sensitivity around healthcare access and cultural factors might influence the findings.","AbstractMaternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, particularly in developing countries, are high even in the twenty-first century, which is a cause for concern. Therefore, this paper examines the Continuum of Mother and Neonatal Health Care (MNH), i.e., at least four ante-natal care visits (ANC 4 +), skilled birth attendance at delivery (SBA), post-natal care (PNC), and its determinants in 10 developing countries in Asia. It uses Demographic and Household Survey data (2014–2021) and finds that only 46% of women received all the MNH services, and 8% did not receive any services. In Afghanistan, only 2.8% of women availed complete care of MNH services, followed by Timor-Leste (26.1%), Bangladesh (31.5%), Pakistan (35.1%), and Nepal (38.8%). Empirical analysis shows that women with higher education, those living in urban areas, from wealthy families, and female-headed households have higher odds of availing all MNH. Media exposure, ease of access to MNH services, and the women who have attended the first ANC at less than four months of pregnancy have higher odds of availing all three MNH services. Therefore, the MNH policy should target women in rural areas who have a lower level of education and come from low-income families to improve the mother and neonatal health situation in South and Southeast Asia."

Differences in resilience profiles between military veterans and the general population: An exploratory latent profile analysis using the HUNT-4 survey,"Andreas Espetvedt Nordstrand, Hans Jakob Bøe, Odin Hjemdal, Ann Hergatt Huffman, Laura Katherine Noll, Jon Gerhard Reichelt, Lars‐Petter Bakker, Frederick Anyan",https://doi.org/10.1002/smi.3343,2023-11-6,"['Forsvarsnett', 'Northern Arizona University', 'Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet']",Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"AbstractUsing latent profile analyses, the current work investigated levels of adverse childhood experiences, symptoms of anxiety and depression and 3 dimensions of relational promotive factors) to identify resilience profiles in a large general population sample (N = 161,622, mean age = 53.02; SD = 17.80; 56.1% females). We then used the same method to identify the resilience profiles of military veterans (N = 386, mean age = 43.47; SD = 10.08; 9.8% females), all of whom had served in Afghanistan. A four‐profile‐solution was the best fitting for the general population (High resilient 30%, Moderate resilient 13%, Low resilient 53%, Work/social‐based resilience 4%), while a three‐profile‐solution had the best fit in the veteran cohort (Family‐based resilience 28%, Work/social‐based resilience 62%, Hardy loners 10%). To ground the identified profiles in occupational function, we also checked how they predicted reports of sleep difficulties, job demand and job control. Despite both samples inhabiting a geographic region known for high socioeconomic similarity among residents, we found marked differences in profile‐solutions between the military veterans and the general population. Our findings suggests that resilience profiles are highly influenced by cohort characteristics and the specific resources needed to manage a given stressor load. Accordingly, the generalisability of specific protective factors may be low across distinct cohorts, and reliable findings need to be obtained in specific populations as defined by stressor context, sample characteristics, and relevant outcomes."
How was the Taliban 2.0 in Afghanistan seen in Pakistan?,"Muhammad Akram, Dania Mohamad, Adeela Arshad-Ayaz",https://doi.org/10.1177/20578911231172197,2023-5-11,['Concordia University'],Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available," The Taliban 2.0 in Afghanistan took the world by surprise. This article investigates how this event was seen differently in varied contexts, such as neighboring Pakistan. Our research shows epistemological pluralism in Pakistan, i.e. how different groups use different ways of knowing (epistemology), being (ontology), and valuing (axiology) to explain and analyze Taliban 2.0. Conceptually, the paper draws on insights from the relationality theory to demonstrate the reasons behind such epistemological pluralism. The theory of relationality provides the grounds for epistemological pluralism, i.e. the mixed sentiments and feelings among respondents about the Taliban 2.0 in Afghanistan. Our research reports the perspectives of nine selected civil society activists about Taliban 2.0 in Afghanistan and its implications for Pakistan. The respondents were interviewed during the second quarter of the Taliban administering Afghanistan. Some called it the victory of Islam, the freedom of Afghans from foreign occupation, and the protection of the Pakistani border from Indian proxies. Others were worried about the risks of increased extremism and terrorism in Pakistan, including the rise of banned organizations like Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan. This study intends to document the interviewee civil society activists’ suggestions to the State of Pakistan for dealing with Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. "
Ruling the Periphery: Pakistan state ruling practices in Lower Dir,"Usman Khan, Shakir Ullah, Tao Rui",https://doi.org/10.1177/00219096221125801,2022-9-28,['North Minzu University'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available," This article examines Pakistan State’s ruling practices in Lower Dir, a peripheral region. It argues that this peripheral region was ruled by a colonial logic of governmentality. Through a “thick” ethnography of Lower Dir, I documented the militarized and fragmented state practices that Tsing refers to as the “sticky materiality of practical encounters” of the local people with the state apparatuses. The study collected data through anthropological methods such as mobile ethnography at checkpoints, casual conversations with locals, and firsthand observations of state ruling practices in the region. This article concludes that it is the Pakistan state’s strategic interest that keeps the region out of the mainstream, and its security status is now even more important for Pakistan state following the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in August 2021.

Hope in hardship: Charting a new course for mental health in Afghanistan,Alvin Kuowei Tay,https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2024.66,2024-5-7,['UNSW Sydney'],Review,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Maternal Health', 'Gender', 'Gender Apartheid']",,"1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context**: Afghanistan's longstanding history of conflict, notably the Soviet invasion in 1979 and the rise and resurgence of the Taliban, has deeply affected the nation's social structure and mental health. The recent Taliban takeover in 2021 has further destabilized the country economically and socially, exacerbating mental health issues due to poverty, lack of basic services, ongoing conflict, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research aims to explore mental health and psychosocial support needs in Afghanistan, focusing on specific human rights challenges related to mental health care access, cultural sensitivity in interventions, and the heightened vulnerability of groups such as women, minorities, youth, and people with disabilities.

3. **Research Methods**: The study is a systematic review conducted by Alemi et al., analyzing decades of peer-reviewed and grey literature to examine mental health trends and issues in Afghanistan. It includes diverse data sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of mental health challenges.

4. **Main Findings**: Significant mental health issues are present among Afghan populations due to ongoing conflict, economic instability, and social disintegration. Vulnerable groups, including women, minorities, the LGBTQ community, youth, refugees, and older adults, face acute mental health challenges, exacerbated by cultural and societal stigma.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The article touches upon the broader challenges faced due to limited rights and access to health services, particularly under the Taliban regime, which restricts women's rights and exacerbates mental health issues through systemic discrimination and lack of support structures.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors advocate for culturally sensitive and comprehensive mental health interventions that consider the historical and social context. They recommend more equitable health care systems and urge research that thoroughly examines vulnerable populations, assesses interventions' effectiveness, and engages with local and international stakeholders.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study acknowledges its limitation in not assessing the quality and potential bias of the included studies, which could affect the robustness of conclusions. Additionally, the volatile political situation in Afghanistan poses challenges in data collection and sensitivity surrounding human rights issues. There's also a need for in-depth analysis of interventions' long-term effectiveness.","Summary
	  The long legacy of upheavals and deprivations in Afghanistan and the associated mental health impacts on its people are well documented. A systematic review undertaken by Alemi et al (2023) presents the most comprehensive synthesis to date on this topic. Drawing on their findings, this editorial examines the complex mental health and psychosocial challenges confronted by neglected vulnerable groups such as pregnant and postnatal women, LGBTQ individuals, older adults, ethnic minority groups and Afghan refugees living overseas. It explores the potential challenges in rebuilding a resilient mental health system following the mass exodus of Afghanis. It calls for a whole-of-society approach that extends beyond clinical interventions to address the broader sociocultural and economic factors influencing mental health."

Historically, RR-TB has required long, complex, and often toxic treatment, posing challenges particularly in regions with limited healthcare resources.

1. **Historical and Social Context:** Tuberculosis remains a significant public health challenge worldwide, with drug-resistant strains complicating treatment efforts. Vulnerable populations, including children, face heightened risks due to less effective treatment options.

2. **Purpose of the Study:** The research aimed to assess new treatment regimens for RR-TB, specifically asking whether shorter, all-oral treatments could be safer and more effective, addressing the human rights challenges of prolonged and toxic treatment especially for children.

3. **Research Methods:** The study involved clinical trials evaluating both 9-month/7-drug and 6-month/4-drug regimens. However, children were not included in these trials, highlighting a significant gap.

4. **Main Findings:** The trials showed promising results for adults, informing WHO guidelines for RR-TB and pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR-TB). Unfortunately, these findings do not extend to children, who continue to endure longer, more toxic regimens.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:** The article implies gaps in the application of health guidelines that fail to address the needs of children, posing human rights concerns regarding equitable access to safe and effective treatment.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:** The authors conclude that more inclusive trials are necessary to address the treatment needs of children with RR-TB. They advocate for developing WHO guidelines inclusive of children’s needs to ensure equitable treatment access.

7. **Study Limitations:** The exclusion of children from the trials highlights a critical limitation, leaving their treatment needs unmet. Furthermore, the political and resource constraints in many under-resourced countries exacerbate these challenges, affecting data availability and the implementation of more equitable treatment frameworks.",No abstract available
Resilience and Positive Wellbeing Experienced by 5–12-Year-Old Children with Refugee Backgrounds in Australia: The Childhood Resilience Study,"Elisha Riggs, Deirdre Gartland, Josef Szwarc, Mardi Stow, Georgia Paxton, Stephanie J. Brown",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph21050627,2024-5-15,"['University of Melbourne', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute""]",Article,1,Yes,"['Humanitarian and Development Assistance', 'Culture, Society, and Heritage']","['Migration', 'Society']",,"**Summary of the Article:**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**
   - The study situates itself in the backdrop of a significant global refugee crisis, with over 108.4 million people forcibly displaced worldwide, half of whom are children. The context includes the various adversities faced by refugee families due to war, conflict, and human rights abuses, impacting physical, social, emotional, and cognitive outcomes for refugee children.

2. **Purpose of the Research**
   - The Childhood Resilience Study (CRS) aims to investigate the resilience of children, specifically those with a refugee background, by understanding how they leverage personal, familial, educational, and cultural strengths to cope with adversity. It addresses the challenge of inadequate culturally appropriate tools to measure resilience and seeks to develop a new measurement tool, the Child Resilience Questionnaire (CRQ).

3. **Research Methods**
   - The study used community-based participatory methods, including co-designing the Child Resilience Questionnaire with input from Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, and refugee-background communities. Data were collected from parents/caregivers of over 1000 children aged 5-12, using multi-platform questionnaires. Statistical analyses, including regression models, were employed to compare resilience scores and demographic characteristics.

4. **Main Findings**
   - Children of refugee background displayed positive wellbeing, with over half having high resilience scores. They scored higher in personal, school, and community strengths but lower in family strengths than other children in the study. Despite experiencing significant adversity, the resilience of these children was positively correlated with their emotional and behavioral wellbeing. No gender differences were found in resilience scores among refugee-background children.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies**
   - The study does not specifically examine the legal frameworks or policies related to human rights, but it does acknowledge the impact of host countries' political and social structures on refugee settlement experiences, highlighting issues like discrimination, socioeconomic disadvantage, and intergenerational trauma.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**
   - The authors conclude that children of refugee background exhibit significant resilience despite adversity. They recommend interventions aimed at enhancing access to resilience resources as these have both immediate and long-term benefits. They stress the need for culturally appropriate measurements of resilience and highlight the importance of strong family and community connections.

7. **Limitations of the Study**
   - Limitations include the lack of diversity in understanding resilience across different refugee backgrounds and the potential bias due to various sociopolitical, cultural, and economic settings. The authors note the challenges in accurately capturing the complex transactional process of resilience, constrained by available data and the sensitive political climate around refugee issues. Further research is needed to fully grasp the resilience mechanisms specific to various refugee experiences and backgrounds.","Refugee research tends to be deficit based and focused on the risks threatening positive adaptation and wellbeing. High rates of mental (and physical) health issues have been reported for refugee adults and children, including intergenerational trauma. This study uses the new Child Resilience Questionnaire (CRQ), co-designed with refugee background communities, to describe resilience and positive wellbeing experienced by children of refugee-background. The Childhood Resilience Study (CRS) recruited 1132 families with children aged 5–12 years in Victoria and South Australia, Australia. This included the recruitment of 109 families from 4 refugee background communities: Assyrian Chaldean (Iraq, Syria), Hazara (Afghanistan), Karen (Burma, Thailand) and Sierra Leonean families. CRQ-parent/caregiver report (CRQ-P/C) scores were categorised into ‘low’, ‘moderate’ and ‘high’. The child’s emotional and behavioural wellbeing was assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, with positive wellbeing defined as &lt;17 on the total difficulties score. Tobit regression models adjusted for a child’s age. The CRQ-P/C scores were not different for boys and girls of refugee background. Children of refugee-background (n = 109) had higher average CRQ-P/C scores than other CRS children (n = 1023) in the personal, school and community domains, but were lower in the family domain. Most children with ‘high’ resilience scores had positive wellbeing for both children of refugee-background (94.6%) and other CRS children (96.5%). Contrary to common stereotypes, children of refugee-background show specific individual, family, school and cultural strengths that can help them navigate cumulative and complex risks to sustain or develop their positive wellbeing. A better understanding as to how to build strengths at personal, family, peer, school and community levels where children are vulnerable is an important next step. Working in close collaboration with refugee communities, schools, policy makers and key service providers will ensure the optimal translation of these findings into sustainable practice and impactful public policy."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The study is set within the context of Pakistan, where colon cancer is the fourth most common cancer. It takes place at the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Institute and Research Centre in Peshawar, a newly established tertiary care center, reflecting advancements in healthcare infrastructure and cancer treatment in the region.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research aims to assess the demographic involvement and short-term outcomes of elective laparoscopic colon cancer resections in Pakistan. It addresses the challenge of improving survival rates through early detection and advanced surgical techniques.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study is a retrospective analysis conducted on elective laparoscopic colorectal resections from April 2021 to February 2022. It involves 157 cases, focusing on patients over 18 with biopsy-confirmed colon cancer. Statistical analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations with SPSS-22.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - Of 157 colorectal cases, 79 were colon cancers.
   - Predominantly affected males (77.2%) and most prevalent in ages 36-45.
   - Many patients originated from KPK (69.6%) and Afghanistan (24%).
   - Tumors primarily located in the ascending colon, with the majority moderately differentiated.
   - Minimal morbidity and mortality rates reported, with a 90-day mortality rate of 2%. There were low post-operative complication rates including one readmission and no anastomotic leaks.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies:**
   While the study doesn't specifically examine Pakistan's legal frameworks, it implicitly highlights the role of enhanced healthcare institutions and policies in improving cancer treatment outcomes.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that elective laparoscopic colonic surgeries are safe and effective, with minimal post-operative complications and excellent short-term outcomes. They advocate for the preference of laparoscopic techniques over traditional methods and recommend larger studies to further improve healthcare delivery for colon cancer.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The study's limitations include its retrospective nature, a limited sample size, and a short duration. Furthermore, the political climate and healthcare policies in Pakistan may influence data availability and applicability of findings on a broader scale. The sensitivity of health data in certain regions might also impact comprehensive analysis.","Objective: In Pakistan, colon cancer ranks fourth in incidence, exhibiting survival rates of 90% to 14%, contingent on TNM staging and early detection. This research focuses on the demographic involvement and short-term outcomes of elective colon cancer resections at a newly established tertiary care cancer center utilizing laparoscopic procedures.&#x0D;
Method: A retrospective analysis of elective laparoscopic colorectal resections at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Peshawar, from April 2021 to February 2022 was conducted. Out of 157 cases, 79 had colon cancer. Criteria included patients &gt;18 years old with positive biopsies; consent non-providers were excluded. Statistical analysis employed descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations using SPSS-22.&#x0D;
Results: The study encompassed biopsy-confirmed colon cancers in patients &gt;18 years. 157 colorectal cases were performed, including 79 colon cancers. The sample comprised 61 males (77.2%) and 18 females (22.7%), mean age 42 years. Most patients (33%) were in the 36-45 age group. Majority were from KPK (69.6%), followed by Afghanistan (24%). Tumors were predominantly in the ascending colon (30.3%). Most were moderately differentiated (70.8%). Mean lymph node yield was 19.0, with 1.2% requiring open laparotomy. Post-discharge, one readmission occurred within 30 days. Mortality within 90 days was 2%, attributed to aspiration pneumonia and chemotherapy-related effects.&#x0D;
Conclusions: Elective laparoscopic colonic surgery exhibits safety and efficacy in treating colon cancer. The study provides evidence of minimal morbidity and mortality, low readmission rates, and absence of anastomotic leaks. Hence, elective laparoscopic colonic surgery should be favored due to fewer post-operative complications and superior short-term outcomes. Larger studies on colon cancer are imperative for enhanced healthcare delivery.&#x0D;

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude there is a dire need for culturally sensitive psychological support and interventions. They advocate for increased mental health services, education on mental health, reconnecting families, and government action plans to address these challenges. Evidence-based psychological interventions and service delivery are essential for Afghan children and adolescents.

7. **Limitations:**
   Limited availability and quality of studies hamper understanding of mental health prevalence. The political climate since 2021 poses challenges for data collection and delivering interventions, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches adaptable to the context in Afghanistan.

Overall, the article underscores the urgent requirement for comprehensive mental health support for Afghan children, emphasizing the importance of culturally appropriate interventions amidst ongoing political and societal challenges.","Abstract
                Purpose of Review
                This review provides an overview of recent literature examining psychological problems in the context of political violence among Afghan children.
              
                Recent Findings
                Using recent literature (2018–2023) we identified: 1) heightened levels of psychological problems experienced by children in Afghanistan; 2) the factors associated with these psychological problems, including loss of family and community members, poverty, continuous risk of injury and death, gender, substance use, war, daily stressors, and poor access to education; 3) psychological problems have potentially worsened since the 2021 political changes; 4) conflict and poverty have resulted in violence against children being a serious issue; 5) emerging psychological interventions have been adapted to Afghan contexts; and 6) there is a desperate need for psychological assistance and further research in the region.
              
                Summary
                All children in Afghanistan have experienced conflict and political violence. While children are not responsible for this conflict, it has impacted their mental health. Further research is needed to examine the development and evaluation of interventions.

Encountering the hostile environment: Recently arrived Afghan migrants in London,"LOUISE RYAN, MARÍA LÓPEZ, ALESSIA DALCEGGIO",https://doi.org/10.1177/02610183231194876,2024-3-18,['London Metropolitan University'],Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available," Following the dramatic evacuation from Kabul airport in August 2021, the UK government proclaimed its commitment to a ‘warm welcome’ for Afghans. In this paper we draw on original qualitative research to explore the emerging experiences of evacuees, and other recent arrivals, during their first year in London. Using the narratives of our Afghans participants, as well as insights from key stakeholders, we show how they navigated slow, opaque bureaucratic processes and lack of communication with official agencies. As a result of these lengthy processes, many thousands of evacuees remained in temporary hotel accommodation for protracted periods. Drawing on the concept of ‘everyday bordering’, we explore the extent to which Afghan resettlement policies are achieving their objectives. We consider how such policies are birthed within a punitive immigration system, which is designed to ‘wear down’ migrants in the UK, regardless of their reason for migration. Moreover, we argue that the ad hoc response of the Home Office and the Foreign Office has created ‘false distinctions’ between categories of Afghan refugees, reinforcing notions of ‘deserving’ versus ‘underserving’ migrants. This distinction allows the government to present itself as humanitarian, ‘rescuing’ people from Afghanistan, while simultaneously maintaining its commitment to the ‘hostile immigration environment’.

Armed conflicts and experience of intimate partner violence among women in Afghanistan: analysis of the 2015 Afghanistan DHS data,"Abdul Ghani Khatir, Tingshuai Ge, Tolulope Ariyo, Quanbao Jiang",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2023-075957,2024-4-5,"[""Xi'an Jiaotong University""]",Article,1,Yes,"['Security and Conflict', 'Human Rights']","['Peace Initiatives', 'Gender']",,"### Summary of the Article

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context**
   - Afghanistan has endured over four decades of continuous conflict, significantly impacting its society. From the Soviet invasion to the US involvement and Taliban’s resurgence, these periods have led to massive casualties and mass displacement. The latest Taliban takeover revived severe security threats, affecting the social fabric and human rights, particularly intensifying issues like intimate partner violence (IPV).

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**
   - The research aims to explore the relationship between armed conflicts and intimate partner violence (IPV) experienced by women in Afghanistan, addressing a critical human rights issue. It examines how conflicts increase IPV incidence and the role of women's attitudes toward IPV in moderating this relationship.

3. **Research Methods**
   - Utilizing the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey (AFDHS), the study employed a multilevel logistic regression model to analyze IPV data. It focused on married women’s experiences with IPV, using cross-sectional data and statistical techniques to account for data hierarchy.

4. **Main Findings**
   - The study found that 52.69% of women experienced IPV, with emotional, physical, and sexual violence rates being significantly high. There is a positive association between conflict severity and IPV. Women justifying IPV had higher chances of experiencing violence, demonstrating how conflict exacerbates domestic violence issues.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**
   - The article does not delve deeply into legal frameworks but suggests a critical need for policies that address intimate partner violence and empower women, particularly in conflict contexts.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**
   - The authors conclude that conflict significantly increases IPV and underscore the need for a holistic intervention approach. Recommendations include comprehensive IPV prevention programs, trauma-healing initiatives, economic support, and involving women in peace-building processes. Increasing education and societal awareness on domestic violence and creating post-conflict policies is essential.

7. **Limitations of the Study**
   - The study's primary limitations include its reliance on cross-sectional data, which cannot establish causality, and the potential for social desirability and recall biases in reporting IPV. Moreover, it does not account for bidirectional IPV or men’s experiences, limiting the analysis's scope. Conducting longitudinal studies amidst conflict poses challenges but would offer more clarity on causal relationships.","ObjectiveArmed conflicts and intimate partner violence (IPV) impose a burden on individual and societal well-being. Given the history of armed conflict in Afghanistan and the high prevalence of IPV, this study aims to examine the influence of armed conflicts on IPV among Afghan women.MethodsMultilevel logistic regression models were applied to the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey (N=10 414 women aged 15–49). Armed conflict severity was measured using the conflict index issued by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, IPV was measured by three types of violence, including emotional, physical and sexual violence. All analyses were conducted by using STATA V.15.1.ResultsOver 52% of women experienced at least one type of IPV, with 33.01%, 49.07%, and 8.99% experiencing emotional, physical, and sexual violence, respectively. The regression results show that armed conflicts were significantly and positively associated with the experience of all types of IPV. In addition, the association between armed conflicts and the experience of emotional IPV was positively moderated by women’s attitudes towards IPV.ConclusionOur findings suggest that women living in high-conflict regions were more prone to experience IPV, particularly women with positive attitudes towards IPV. Promoting progressive gender roles, women’s empowerment, awareness of IPV and inclusion of women in conflict resolution will help deal with the issue of IPV."
Pakistan in 2023 A Year of Desperate Survival,Mariam Mufti,https://doi.org/10.1525/as.2024.64.2.211,,['University of Waterloo'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"Economic uncertainty, political instability, and security concerns marked 2023 as a year where the country desperately tried to survive. The year began with Pakistan on the brink of sovereign default, with depleting foreign reserves and soaring inflation. Although successful negotiations with the IMF averted economic catastrophe, political crisis seemed to replace the country’s economic woes. In the second half of 2023, following Imran Khan’s temporary arrest on May 9, political confrontation between the military and Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaaf resulted in the worst democratic backsliding witnessed in recent years. Although Pakistan heads to the polls in the new year, it appears to be saddled by the weight of the political status quo."

This study examined gender differences in a range of mental health outcomes within three levels of war zone trauma exposure and investigated gender differences in risk and protective factors associated with clinical mental health problems. Using data from a cross‐sectional, postdeployment survey, a sample of Norwegian veterans of recent military operations in Afghanistan (N = 6,205, 8.3% women) were sorted according to reported war zone trauma exposure level (low, medium, high), then assessed for symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), posttraumatic distress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and alcohol problems. The findings revealed that men who reported low war zone exposure had lower levels of posttraumatic distress symptoms than women, d = ‐0.20, p = .040, but were more likely to report symptoms of alcohol problems within the low, d = 0.33, p &lt; .001; medium, d = 0.39, p &lt; .001; and high, d = 0.37, p = .049, exposure groups; however, these differences disappeared when all symptom variables were combined into one clinical mental health problem variable. Women with a clinical mental health problem were less likely to report war zone exposure than men, OR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.90, 0.97], p = .001. Findings suggest that although gender differences in mental health symptoms exist, male and female veterans with mental health problems may share more similarities than previously recognized."

‘Women helping women’: Deploying gender in US counterinsurgency wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,Naomi Head,https://doi.org/10.1177/09670106231203839,2023-11-23,['University of Glasgow'],Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available," Central to the goal of ‘hearts and minds’ counterinsurgency is the need for knowledge, understanding and influence in relation to local populations. Building on feminist scholarship on counterinsurgency, the article focuses on the ‘female engagement’ work undertaken by four programmes developed by the US military between 2003 and 2014. The article offers three key arguments. First, it maintains that the gendered subjectivities of Iraqi and Afghan women and US female counterinsurgents are constructed as strategic assets and as vulnerable subjects. Second, these programmes reveal the extent to which gendered counterinsurgency is constituted and regulated by emotional and embodied norms and rules for both female soldiers and civilians. Third, it suggests that the discursive construction of ‘winning hearts and minds’ works to render less visible the violence of gendered counterinsurgency practices. Although gendered counterinsurgency mobilizes a relational ontology predicated on the emotional labour required for developing knowledge of the Iraqi and Afghan ‘other’, female engagement activities cannot escape the logic of instrumental reasoning within which they are located. Ultimately, recognizing the policy of female engagement as central to forms of knowledge production reveals the extent to which the violences of war rely on a complex set of gendered and affective relations.

Courting Civilians during Conflict: Evidence from Taliban Judges in Afghanistan,"Donald Grasse, Renard Sexton, Austin Wright",https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818324000031,2024-3-18,['The University of Chicago'],Article,1,Yes,"['Security and Conflict', 'Governance']","['Civil Society', 'Peace Initiatives', 'Military Actions']",,"### Summary of the Article on Rebel Courts in Afghanistan

1. **Context**: The study examines the role of Taliban courts in Afghanistan from the late 2000s to early 2010s. Following the 2001 U.S.-led invasion that ousted the Taliban from power, the group re-emerged as an insurgent force, opposing the Kabul government supported by international forces. Amidst this insurgency, the Taliban provided mobile judicial services, establishing a parallel governance structure in areas under their influence.

2. **Purpose**: The research investigates how the Taliban's provision of judicial services influences civilian attitudes and behaviors, and the implications for insurgency dynamics and human rights. A specific focus is on understanding whether these courts foster civilian support and how this impacts conflict dynamics.

3. **Methods**: The study employs data on Taliban court locations and operational periods, cross-referencing these with survey data on civilian attitudes and conflict event data. The authors use a trajectory-balancing methodology to estimate the impact of court presence on civilian and insurgent activities.

4. **Findings**: The introduction of Taliban courts led to decreased reliance on state courts and increased support for the Taliban among civilians. This shift in public opinion correlated with a rise in insurgent attacks, including both direct fire and IED incidents. Civilians were less inclined to report IEDs after the establishment of Taliban courts, indicating potential collaboration with insurgents.

5. **Legal Frameworks**: The study highlights the hybrid nature of Taliban governance, which did not fully replace but interacted with the state's legal systems. Taliban courts were presented as more accessible and culturally resonant than state courts, particularly in rural areas.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that rebel courts can significantly influence conflict outcomes by altering civilian attitudes, underscoring the importance of addressing parallel governance structures in conflict zones. They recommend that policymakers consider how judicial services by insurgents affect civilian allegiances and inform counterinsurgency strategies.

7. **Limitations**: The study is limited by its focus on a single country and insurgent group, potentially impacting the generalizability of findings. The volatile political climate and challenges in data collection during insurgencies add layers of complexity to the analysis.

This comprehensive analysis of Taliban courts provides critical insights into the strategies of insurgent governance and its effects on conflict and civilian behavior. The lessons drawn could inform future interventions in similar conflict settings worldwide.","AbstractRebels regularly provide public services, especially legal services, but the consequences of such programs are unclear. We argue that rebel courts can boost civilian support for insurgency and augment attack capacity by increasing the legitimacy of the rebellion, creating a vested interest in rebel rule, or enabling rebel coercion of the civilian population. We study the impact of the Taliban's judiciary by leveraging cross-district and over-time variation in exposure to Taliban courts using a trajectory-balancing design. We find that rebel courts reduced civilian support for the government and increased it for the Taliban, and were associated with more attacks and more coalition casualties. Exploring mechanisms, we find that courts resolved major interpersonal disputes between civilians but also facilitated more insurgent intimidation of civilians, and that changes in public opinion are unlikely to have been driven solely by social desirability bias. Our findings help explain the logic of rebel courts and highlight the complex interactions between warfare and institutional development in weak states."
"Holding the Taliban Accountable for Gender Persecution: The Search for New Accountability Paradigms under International Human Rights Law, International Criminal Law and Women, Peace, and Security",Rangita de Silva de Alwis,https://doi.org/10.1017/glj.2023.113,2024-3-6,['University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School'],Article,1,Yes,['Human Rights'],"['Gender', 'Gender Apartheid', 'Policy Reform']",,"**Summary of Article: ""Gender Persecution in International Law""**

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   The article examines the historical exclusion of women from international law-making processes, which has led to gendered disparities within legal frameworks. It focuses on the concept of ""gender apartheid"" in Afghanistan under Taliban rule, marking a pivotal moment in recognizing systemic gender discrimination at the global level.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges:**
   The research aims to address gender persecution, particularly within the context of Afghanistan, by examining the evolving concept of gender apartheid. It seeks to establish new international accountability mechanisms for gender-based human rights violations, with broader implications for crimes of gender persecution worldwide.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The article analyzes reports from the UN Special Rapporteur and Working Group on discrimination against women and girls, based on visits to Afghanistan and interviews with over 2,000 Afghan citizens. It also reviews legal standards and frameworks, such as the Rome Statute and its provisions on gender persecution.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The authors identify severe gender discrimination in Afghanistan, potentially amounting to gender persecution—a crime against humanity. Similarities are drawn between current conditions in Afghanistan and past cases handled by the ICC, such as the Al Hassan case in Mali, reinforcing the systemic nature of these violations.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   The article discusses the Rome Statute, highlighting its inclusive approach to gender-based crimes, such as gender persecution, and contrasts it with previous tribunals that focused on narrower grounds. It also reviews the ICC’s evolving legal policies, including the 2014 and 2022 Gender Persecution Policies, aimed at addressing gaps in prosecuting gender-related crimes.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that international law must broaden its recognition and prosecution of gender-based crimes. They advocate for comprehensive accountability measures for gender persecution, emphasizing the importance of recognizing systemic gender discrimination as a crime against humanity. They recommend that international bodies continue adapting legal frameworks to reflect evolving human rights norms.

7. **Limitations:**
   Challenges include the political climate in Afghanistan, which may hinder data collection and reporting. The sensitivity of human rights issues and ongoing conflicts also pose risks to accurate reporting and accountability efforts.

This summary encapsulates the core arguments and findings of the article, focusing on the evolution and application of international legal standards concerning gender-based human rights violations.","AbstractIn this paper, I will examine the legal standards of gender persecution and the evolving descriptor gender apartheid as a way to describe the status of women in Afghanistan. The paper also examines other complementary forms of legal accountability procedures to vindicate Afghan women’s rights and hold perpetrators accountable under crimes against humanity. Although the current locus of the paper is focused on Afghan women, it has larger implications for all other crimes of gender persecution."
Increasing Burden of Lower-Extremity Fractures in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) A 30-Year Epidemiological Analysis,"Amir Human Hoveidaei, Amin Nakhostin-Ansari, Nathanael D. Heckmann, Seyed Hossein Hosseini-Asl, Mohammad Saeid Khonji, Mohammad Razi, Behnaz Mahdaviani, Natalie M. Kistler, Amiethab A. Aiyer",https://doi.org/10.2106/JBJS.23.00489,2024-1-22,['Neuroscience Institute “Neurorehabilitation“'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"
            Background:
            Lower-extremity fractures (LEFs) account for &gt;30% of all skeletal injuries, contributing to the global health and economic burden. Fracture epidemiology in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has been studied little. Health factors and disease epidemiology differ greatly among populations in MENA despite cultural, political, and economic similarities among the region’s countries. This study examined the epidemiology of LEFs and the need for rehabilitation in MENA from 1990 to 2019.
          
          
            Methods:
            We examined the epidemiology of fractures of the pelvis, hip, femur, patella, tibia, fibula, ankle, and foot bones using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data. Fracture incidence, counts, and rates were measured for males and females across age groups in the 21 MENA countries as identified by the GBD data set. Associations between years of healthy life lost due to disability (YLD) resulting from fracture and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) were analyzed.
          
          
            Results:
            In contrast to the global trend, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of LEFs in the MENA region increased by 4.57% from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, the highest ASIR among fractures was attributed to fractures of the patella, fibula, tibia, or ankle (434.36 per 100,000), most frequently occurring among those 20 to 24 years of age. In 2019, the highest ASIR of all fractures was noted in Saudi Arabia (2,010.56 per 100,000) and the lowest, in Sudan (523.29 per 100,000). The greatest increases from 1990 to 2019 in the ASIR of LEFs were noted in Yemen (132.39%), Syria (107.27%), and Afghanistan (94.47%), while the largest decreases were found in Kuwait (−62.72%), Sudan (−48.72%), and Iran (−45.37%). In 2019, the YLD rate of LEFs had increased to 277.65 per 100,000, up from 235.55 per 100,000 in 1990.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Between 1990 and 2019, LEFs increased in the MENA region. Violence, war, and road traffic accidents increased, leading to a high rate of fractures, especially among youth. Low bone-mineral density related to vitamin D deficiency has also been reported as a risk factor for fracture in the region. Regional health authorities should be informed of fracture patterns by this study.

Comparing the Emergency Care of Iranian and Afghan Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Milad Ahmadi Gohari, Maryam Chegeni‬‬, Mohammad Hossein Mehrolhassani, Ali Akbar Haghdoost, Moghaddameh Mirzaee",https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2024.22,2024-3-1,"['Modeling in Health Research Center, Institute for Futures Studies in Health, Kerman University of Medical Sciences']",Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"Background: This study investigated the quality of inpatient care provided to Afghan immigrants in Iran during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 2019 to March 2021). For this purpose, the services received by Afghan immigrants were compared with those received by Iranian citizens. Methods: Two emergency services (traumas with 8080 victims and 8,686 patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection) were taken into consideration. The records of all patients, including the Afghan immigrants, in two referral hospitals in Kerman were reviewed, and the main variables were the length of hospitalization (LoH), intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, and death rate. Quantile regression, multiple logistic regression, and Cox regression were used to analyze the data. Results: The median and interquartile range of LoH for Afghan and Iranian nationals admitted due to traumas were 3.0±4.0 and 2.0±4.0, respectively (P&lt;0.01). Moreover, the chance of Afghan nationals being admitted to the ICU (38%, odds ratio=1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.12; 1.69) and the hazard of death (60%, hazard rate=1.60; 95% CI=1.03; 2.49) were higher compared to Iranian nationals, which is statistically significant. However, no significant differences were observed between the COVID-19 patients from the two nationalities in terms of the median LoH, the odds of being admitted to the ICU, and the hazard of death due to COVID-19. Conclusion: Afghan nationals admitted to the hospital due to traumas were more likely to be admitted to ICUs or die compared to Iranian citizens. It seems that Afghan patients who had traumas went to the hospitals with more serious injuries. There was no difference between Afghan and Iranian patients in terms of COVID-19 consequences. Following the findings of this study, it seems that justice in treatment has been fully established for Afghan patients in Iran."

Here's a summary of the main points requested:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Ibogaine is derived from the root bark of West African plants and has been used for spiritual purposes in the Bwiti tradition. In the Western world, it was initially used as an antidepressant before being banned, but gained attention for its potential use in treating addiction.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The research aims to investigate ibogaine's effectiveness in treating PTSD and substance use disorders, particularly in veterans. These conditions present significant challenges, including high suicide rates and a lack of effective treatments.

3. **Research Methods**: The article discusses various studies, including observational studies and a few randomized controlled trials (RCTs), focusing mostly on ibogaine's impact on addiction and PTSD. It highlights ibogaine's action on various neurotransmitter receptors which might explain its therapeutic effects.

4. **Main Findings**: Early evidence indicates that ibogaine can significantly reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms for opioids and cocaine. Studies also found promising reductions in PTSD, depression, and suicidal ideation, especially among military veterans. However, ibogaine use carries risks, such as potential cardiotoxicity, which can lead to fatal heart arrhythmias.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The article acknowledges ongoing legal and ethical considerations surrounding ibogaine's use and its cultural origins. It references efforts under the Nagoya Protocol to ensure sustainable harvesting and equitable benefit-sharing among indigenous communities.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors suggest that while ibogaine shows promise, more extensive clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy. They advocate for the establishment of formal clinical practices to enhance patient safety and address ethical considerations regarding cultural use and resource management.

7. **Limitations**: The article points out potential limitations, such as the limited data from large-scale, double-blind RCTs, and the risks associated with ibogaine's cardiotoxicity. It also highlights ethical concerns about the cultural and ecological impacts of increasing demand for ibogaine.

In conclusion, ibogaine may offer a novel treatment avenue for veterans with PTSD and substance use disorders, but further research and careful clinical management are necessary to fully understand and mitigate its risks.","
            Background:
            Ibogaine is a plant-derived alkaloid that has been used for thousands of years in rites of passage and spiritual ceremonies in West-Central Africa. In the West, it has primarily been used and studied for its anti-addictive properties and more recently for other neuropsychiatric indications, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and traumatic brain injury.
          
          
            Areas of Uncertainty:
            Ibogaine requires careful patient screening and monitoring because of significant safety issues. There is potential for cardiotoxicity (prolonged QT interval); without rigorous screening, fatal arrhythmias may occur. However, preliminary research suggests that co-administration of ibogaine with magnesium may mitigate cardiotoxicity. Additionally, ibogaine may have dangerous interactions with opiates, so patients who receive ibogaine treatment for opioid use disorder must withdraw from long-acting opioids. Other potential concerning effects of ibogaine include rare incidences of mania or psychosis. Anticipated transient effects during ibogaine treatment can include ataxia, tremors, and gastrointestinal symptoms.
          
          
            Therapeutic Advances:
            Robust effects after a single treatment with ibogaine have been reported. In open-label and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), ibogaine reduces heroin and opioid cravings by upwards of 50%, up to 24 weeks after the treatment. An observational study of 30 Special Operations Forces veterans with mild traumatic brain injury reported that 86% were in remission from post-traumatic stress disorder, 83% from depression, and 83% from anxiety, one month after a single-dose ibogaine treatment.
          
          
            Limitations:
            Although there are several observational and open-label studies, there is only a single double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT on ibogaine. More RCTs with large sample sizes must be conducted to support ibogaine's safety and efficacy.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Given the promising preliminary findings, ibogaine could potentially fill a much-needed gap in treatments for challenging conditions, including opioid dependence. Ibogaine's remarkable effects in traditionally treatment-resistant, combat-exposed individuals hints at its potential in broader populations with physical and psychological trauma.

A Scoping Review on Malaria Prevention and Control Intervention in Fragile and Conflict-Affected States (FCAS): A Need for Renewed Focus to Enhance International Cooperation,"Sanjay Pattanshetty, Viola Savy Dsouza, Anupama Shekharappa, Maheswara Yagantigari, Rohit Raj, Aniruddha Inamdar, Issam Alsamara, Harsh Rajvanshi, Helmut Brand",https://doi.org/10.1007/s44197-023-00180-7,2024-1-15,"['Prasanna School of Public Health', 'Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences']",Review,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Governance']","['Disease Prevention', 'Nutrition', 'Migration', 'Disaster Risk Reduction']",,"**Summary of the Article:**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Malaria is a critical public health challenge in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations (FCAS) countries, such as Sudan. Conflict has severely disrupted healthcare systems, with over 70% of hospitals in Sudan closing due to ongoing warfare since mid-April. This has left populations highly vulnerable to diseases like malaria, exacerbating public health crises in resource-limited settings. Historically, malaria has influenced diplomatic relations and economic stability internationally, highlighting the necessity for a collaborative and multi-sectoral approach to combat its impacts.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges:**
   The research aims to explore the effectiveness of malaria control interventions in FCAS countries, recognizing the broader impact on health rights and the stability of diplomatic relations. It addresses the urgency of maintaining healthcare during conflicts and the need for sustained global health initiatives like SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) to combat malaria.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study reviewed 62 malaria control intervention trials across FCAS, categorizing interventions by age group and evaluating their impact on malaria morbidity and mortality. It also examined the effectiveness of combined interventions like insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and antimalarial treatments in reducing child mortality.

4. **Main Findings:**
   Despite conflict, some malaria interventions have persisted in FCAS, yet the disease burden remains high. Significant decreases in child mortality correlated with expanded malaria interventions. However, variations in healthcare access and care-seeking practices continue to challenge effective malaria control. International collaborations in FCAS have shown progress, yet further efforts are needed to prevent transmission.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   The paper briefly discusses the role of international partnerships and governmental cooperation in implementing malaria strategies, such as the efforts in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Myanmar, focusing on system strengthening and community engagement.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   Authors conclude that enhancing access and utilization of malaria control interventions is crucial. They recommend region-specific strategies, building local healthcare capacities, and leveraging digital health technologies to overcome access barriers. Strengthening political support and conducting context-specific research are essential to design effective malaria prevention strategies.

7. **Limitations:**
   Limitations include the study's focus on FCAS, where political instability and healthcare system fragility pose significant challenges to data collection and intervention implementation. Sensitivity surrounding health rights in conflict zones further complicates research efforts and data reliability.","AbstractMalaria is a major public health problem in developing countries. The burden of malaria in fragile and conflict-affected states (FCAS) is increasing year by year. Moreover, the population living in FCAS is often the most vulnerable and at high risk of malaria due to factors, such as deteriorating healthcare system, mass relocations, and reduced resilience to shocks. Therefore, this scoping review aims to map the interventions that are conducted at the FCAS on malaria prevention among the general population. In addition, this review can help policy-makers and international health bodies, providing a comprehensive overview that can lead to more targeted, effective, and context-specific interventions. Databases, such as PubMed, EBSCO-CINAHL, Web of Science, ProQuest, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, were searched using specified search terms. A total of 3601 studies were retrieved from the search. After screening, 62 studies were included in the synthesis that met the eligibility criteria. Narrative analysis of the findings was done. The results revealed that in fragile countries, interventions for children below 5 years of age included IPTi, TDA, and ACT. In conflicted countries, interventions for children below 5 years of age included TDA, LLINs, SMC, drug trials, and vaccination. Similar interventions were reported for other age groups and populations. Despite ongoing conflicts, malaria interventions have been maintained in these countries, but a persistent high burden of malaria remains. To achieve the goals of malaria elimination, the results of the review highlight the need for continued research and evaluation of malaria control interventions to assess their effectiveness and impact. Strengthening health systems, building partnerships, utilizing digital health technologies, and conducting context-specific research are recommended to improve healthcare access and reduce the burden of malaria in FCAS."
"Incidence Trends of Inherited Anemias at the Global, Regional, and National Levels Over Three Decades","Hongwei Tang, Nan Zhang, Xinlei Liu, Hongbo Xiao, Hanyue Zhang, Kang Zhou, Jianchuan Deng",https://doi.org/10.1007/s44197-023-00170-9,2023-12-11,['The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University'],Article,1,Yes,['Healthcare and Public Health'],"['Disease Prevention', 'Maternal Health']",,"The article titled ""Global Burden of Inherited Anemias"" examines the global prevalence and trends of inherited anemias from 1990 to 2019, providing significant insights into variations across regions, genders, and specific types of anemias. Here is a summary addressing the specified points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The study spans a nearly three-decade analysis of inherited anemias, focusing on how these conditions affect various global populations. It points out significant disparities in incidence rates geographically and how socio-demographic factors influence public health outcomes related to these diseases.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions**: The research investigates the global burden of inherited anemias, focusing on the epidemiological trends, gender disparities, and regional variations in disease incidence. It implicitly addresses human rights challenges related to access to healthcare and equitable distribution of medical resources.

3. **Research Methods**: The study utilizes statistical data and hierarchical cluster analysis to analyze trends in the incidence of inherited anemias across 204 countries. It categorizes regions based on incidence trends and variations by subtypes of anemias. Key quantitative metrics include estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) and Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) correlations.

4. **Main Findings**: The incidence of inherited anemias increased marginally globally but showed a notable decline in the incidence rate per 100,000 population. Significant geographic variations exist, with the highest rates in African and some Asian regions. Gender disparities are apparent, with females exhibiting higher incidence rates, although this gap is narrowing. The most common types are the G6PD trait, followed by other subtypes, with varied trends in regional prevalence.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The study does not extensively delve into the specific legal frameworks and policies concerning human rights. However, the SDI-related findings hint at the impact of socio-economic factors and potential inequalities in healthcare access and interventions.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The research concludes that socio-demographic development (as indicated by SDI) plays a crucial role in mitigating the incidence of inherited anemias. It suggests the need for targeted public health interventions, particularly in regions with lower SDI scores, to improve outcomes for those affected by these conditions.

7. **Limitations**: The study acknowledges potential limitations related to data availability, regional disparities, and potential biases in official reporting from different countries. The sensitivity of human rights issues is evidenced by the implicit need for better healthcare access and disease management in lower SDI regions.

Overall, the article highlights the significant global burden of inherited anemias, underscoring the need for comprehensive public health strategies tailored to the socio-demographic contexts of different regions to address this ongoing health challenge.","AbstractInherited anemia continues to pose a significant public health concern on a global scale, owing to its extensive geographical prevalence, substantial patient population, and profound ramifications. Here, we investigated detailed information on inherited anemias (including thalassemias, thalassemias trait, sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait, G6PD deficiency, and G6PD trait) for the period 1990–2019 from the Global Burden of Disease study. Over the course of three decades, there has been a persistent rise in the incidence of inherited anemias worldwide, culminating in a total of 44,896,026 incident cases in 2019. However, the prevalence of inherited anemias has exhibited a consistent downward trend over successive years. Significantly, these inherited anemias primarily impact females, exhibiting a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.88. Among males, the most prevalent inherited anemia is G6PD deficiency, whereas G6PD trait prevails among females. The incidence rates of inherited anemias and their temporal trend exhibited significant variations across different regions, with Central Sub-Saharan Africa displaying the highest incidence rates and Central Latin America experiencing the most substantial decline. The findings of this study suggest a significant correlation between the Socio-Demographic index (SDI) and incidence rates of inherited anemias, particularly in regions with lower SDI levels such as Africa and South Asia. These results contribute valuable insights for the analysis of global trends in the burden of inherited anemias."
Barriers and opportunities regarding community-based forest management in Afghanistan: Considerations for fragile states,"Safiullah Khurram, Mohammad Nasir Shalizi, Mujtaba Bashari, Kofi Akamani, John W Groninger",https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892923000280,2023-11-6,['Kabul University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Environment', 'Governance']","['Conservation', 'Policy Reform']",,"The article provides an extensive review of forest management in Afghanistan, focusing on the evolution of policies and practices from the 1960s to 2021. Here is a summary of the key points addressed in the article:

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   Afghanistan's forest management policies evolved from a centralized authoritarian regime to one that increasingly supported community-based management over time. From the Kingdom period in the 1960s to the fall of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) in 2021, Afghanistan's forest policies were issued by various authorities without parliamentary approval until clearer frameworks emerged after 2002.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions:**
   The research explores the changes in forest management, particularly regarding community participation in sustainable forest management. It addresses the challenges of inadequate legal frameworks, institutional overlap, and traditional practices in forest conservation and utilization.

3. **Research Methods:**
   A comprehensive literature review was conducted using Google and Google Scholar, focusing on publications related to forests and policy documents issued by Afghanistan's governments between 1965 and 2021. Documents were translated into English from Dari and Pashto and analyzed for legal and policy evolution.

4. **Main Findings and Human Rights Trends:**
   It was found that up until 2002, Afghanistan's policies did not support community-based forest management. However, post-2002 policies, particularly the Forest Management Law (FML), highlighted community roles in sustainable management. Despite these improvements, ongoing insecurity and governance gaps hindered effective implementation and forest protection.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Institutions:**
   The establishment of the General Directorate of Natural Resources Management (GD-NRM) and NEPA marked efforts to improve governance, albeit with ambiguities in their roles. The FML formalized community participation, but enforcement and practical application lagged due to unclear responsibilities and lack of support.

6. **Authors’ Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that while community-based management structures, like Forest Management Associations (FMAs), were initiated, their potential was undermined by political instability, insufficient funding, and security issues. There's a need for clearer policies, capacity building, and support to enhance the role of FMAs.

7. **Study Limitations:**
   Limitations include the challenge of obtaining accurate data due to Afghanistan's volatile political climate and security concerns. The sensitivity around discussing governance and traditional practices, along with inconsistent international support, impacted the ability to fully address human rights in forest management. 

Overall, the study highlights the complexities and challenges of implementing effective forest management policies in a context marked by political instability, conflicting institutional roles, and limited community empowerment.","SummaryThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA), in power during 2002–2021, initiated the process of instituting community-based forest governance and building local capacity for natural resource management. These efforts coincided with the presence of international security forces and the mobilization of civil society organizations, and they were in response to community aspirations to protect and restore often degraded local forests. Legislation was passed to enable forest protection and management, including a provision to encourage participatory management by local community user groups organized as Forest Management Associations (FMAs). By the end of the GIRoA era, c. 20 registered FMAs were operating with c. 400 others in various stages of development across Afghanistan. Our analysis of relevant policy documents revealed that the policy framework developed during the GIRoA era scores favourably on the ideal criteria for community-based resource management. Despite the change in political administration with the inception of the current Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan regime, the influence of the GIRoA era serves as a starting point and may have enduring influences on rural communities in Afghanistan and the natural resources that support them. Anecdotal evidence suggests that community-based forest management may persist under the current national leadership despite international isolation and funding constraints. The model developed in Afghanistan may be relevant to other fragile states, especially in contexts where rural forest-dependent communities have strong local institutions, such asshuras, and where forests are not prone to heavy extraction pressure."

Primary healthcare system and provider responses to the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan,"Mustafa Basij-Rasikh, Elisa S Dickey, Alyssa Sharkey",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2023-013760,2024-2-20,['Princeton University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Maternal Health', 'Nutrition', 'Disaster Risk Reduction', 'Migration']",,"The study assesses how individuals and organizations responsible for delivering primary healthcare in Afghanistan responded to the systemic shock following the Taliban's takeover in August 2021. It provides insights for health policymakers and implementers in conflict-affected environments, highlighting resilience amidst incredible challenges.

1. **Context**: Afghanistan's health system struggled with fragmentation and under-resourcing for decades. The previous Taliban regime had weakened public health infrastructure. Before August 2021, healthcare largely relied on NGOs under international funding. The Taliban takeover exacerbated existing challenges, including border closures, funding disruptions, and security issues.

2. **Research Purpose**: The study aimed to understand how primary healthcare continued post-Taliban takeover, focusing on resilience and adaptation amidst upheaval. It addressed the human rights aspect of maintaining essential services under conflict and governance changes.

3. **Research Methods**: Through qualitative research, in-depth interviews were conducted with healthcare professionals, decision-makers, and NGO staff via remote media like Zoom. Interviews focused on service delivery, health workforce, governance, and the procurement of medical products. Purposive and snowball sampling helped select participants, ensuring a diversity of experiences and insights.

4. **Main Findings**: Despite challenges, primary health service utilization continued and even increased, helped by the dedication of healthcare workers. However, significant hurdles like funding instability and service delivery were evident. Female health workers faced additional challenges due to fears of restrictive policies by the new Taliban administration. The transition from government to NGO-administered services, reliance on foreign funding, and the adaptation to new governance realities were key themes.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The research highlights how health services, primarily administered by NGOs before the takeover, adjusted to new governance without significant disruption. It stressed the necessity of international collaboration in policy navigation under the Taliban regime.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: While the resilience of healthcare services has been commendable, continuous funding and collaboration are critical. Contractual approaches to service delivery remain effective. Increasing international and local stakeholder synergy is imperative for sustainability and improvement of healthcare, particularly for women and in rural areas.

7. **Limitations**: Data collection during a politically volatile period posed challenges, including limited access to MoPH officials and potential biases from interview sampling. The study focused on primary care, thus not applicable to other healthcare sectors. Political sensitivities and the economic collapse under the regime further constrained research scope and data availability.

The study underscores the vital role of existing healthcare frameworks in maintaining stability and the acute need for flexible international support in fragile contexts.","IntroductionExisting health system challenges in Afghanistan were amplified by the Taliban’s August 2021 government takeover during which the country faced an evolving security situation, border closures, banking interruptions, donor funding disruptions and international staff evacuations. We investigated factors that influenced health sector and health service delivery following the takeover.MethodsWe purposively sampled individuals knowledgeable about Afghanistan’s health sector and health professionals working in underserved areas of the country. We identified codes and themes of the data using framework analysis.ResultsFactors identified as supporting continued health service delivery following August 2021 include external funding and operational flexibilities, ongoing care provision by local implementers and providers, health worker motivation, flexible contracting out arrangements and improved security. Factors identified as contributing to disruptions include damaged infrastructure, limited supplies, ineffective government implementation efforts and changes in government leadership and policies resulting in new coordination and capacity challenges. There were mixed views on the role pay-for-performance schemes played. Participants also shared concerns about the new working environment. These included loss of qualified health professionals and the associated impact on quality of care, continued dependency on external funding, women’s inability to finish their studies or take on any leadership positions, various impacts of the Mahram policy, mental stress, the future of care provision for female patients and widespread economic hardship which impacts nearly every aspect of Afghan life.ConclusionAfghanistan’s health sector presents a compelling case of adaptability in the face of crisis. Despite the anticipated and reported total collapse due to the country’s power shift, various factors enabled health services to continue in some settings while others acted as barriers. The potential role of these factors should be considered in the context of future service delivery in Afghanistan and other settings at risk of political and societal disruption."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common condition among post-9/11 era veterans, particularly those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. TBI is associated with various long-term negative health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, dementia, epilepsy, and poor mental health. Studies on TBI's link to brain cancer have been inconsistent, adding urgency to research in veteran populations.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   - The study aims to investigate whether there is an association between different severities of TBI and the subsequent development of brain cancer in veterans. The primary human rights concern is the health and well-being of veterans who have suffered TBIs.

3. **Research Methods:**
   - A retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 2004 to 2019 involving over 1.9 million veterans. It used administrative data from the Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) to categorize TBI severity and track brain cancer diagnoses using ICD codes.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - Moderate/severe and penetrating TBIs were associated with an increased risk of developing brain cancer, whereas mild TBI was not. The study found statistically significant associations between severe TBIs and later brain cancer incidence.

5. **Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies:**
   - The research was conducted within the regulations overseeing research with veteran populations, which involve collaborations between VA and DoD departments for comprehensive data analysis.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - The study concludes that there is a significant association between severe TBIs and brain cancer, warranting further research to develop screening and preventive protocols. Despite the rarity of brain cancer, its poor prognosis necessitates early identification of at-risk individuals.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   - The study faced limitations including reliance on ICD codes without access to pathological diagnoses, potential exclusions due to data sensitivity, and the specific demographic of primarily young male veterans, which may affect generalizability. Also, other confounding factors like environmental exposures could not be fully controlled for.","ImportanceWhile brain cancer is rare, it has a very poor prognosis and few established risk factors. To date, epidemiologic work examining the potential association of traumatic brain injury (TBI) with the subsequent risk of brain cancer is conflicting. Further data may be useful.ObjectiveTo examine whether a history of TBI exposure is associated with the subsequent development of brain cancer.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA retrospective cohort study was conducted from October 1, 2004, to September 20, 2019, and data analysis was performed between January 1 and June 26, 2023. The median follow-up for the cohort was 7.2 (IQR, 4.1-10.1) years. Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) administrative data on 1 919 740 veterans from the Long-Term Impact of Military-Relevant Brain Injury Consortium–Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium were included.ExposureThe main exposure of interest was TBI severity (categorized as mild, moderate or severe [moderate/severe], and penetrating).Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe outcome of interest was the development of brain cancer based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) or International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnostic codes in either the DoD/VA medical records or from the National Death Index.ResultsAfter 611 107 exclusions (predominately for no encounter during the study period), a cohort including 1 919 740 veterans was included, most of whom were male (80.25%) and non-Hispanic White (63.11%). Median age at index date was 31 (IQR, 25-42) years. The cohort included 449 880 individuals with TBI (mild, 385 848; moderate/severe, 46 859; and penetrating, 17 173). Brain cancer occurred in 318 individuals without TBI (0.02%), 80 with mild TBI (0.02%), 17 with moderate/severe TBI (0.04%), and 10 or fewer with penetrating TBI (≤0.06%). After adjustment, moderate/severe TBI (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.90; 95% CI, 1.16-3.12) and penetrating TBI (AHR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.71-6.49), but not mild TBI (AHR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.88-1.47), were associated with the subsequent development of brain cancer.Conclusions and RelevanceIn this cohort study of veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, moderate/severe TBI and penetrating TBI, but not mild TBI, were associated with the subsequent development of brain cancer."

V.', 'Universitätsmedizin Mainz']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Environment']","['Climate', 'Disease Prevention']",,"**Summary of the Article on Air Pollution and Health in Afghanistan**

1. **Historical and Contextual Overview**: Afghanistan is dealing with the dual challenges of post-conflict recovery and rapid urbanization, which contribute to its high levels of air pollution. In 2019, it ranked fourth globally in Air Quality Index assessments for PM (particulate matter) pollution. Urban areas face increased ambient pollution due to industrial growth, whereas rural areas suffer from indoor pollution due to traditional cooking practices. These conditions pose significant environmental and public health challenges.

2. **Research Purpose and Human Rights Concerns**: The research aims to assess the burden of disease in Afghanistan due to air pollution, addressing significant public health issues that can be linked to human rights challenges, including the right to a healthy environment and protection from preventable illnesses.

3. **Research Methods**: The study utilized data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019 to measure health impacts through metrics like disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and deaths attributed to air pollution in Afghanistan.

4. **Main Findings**: In 2019, Afghanistan experienced 37,033 deaths due to air pollution, constituting 14.72% of total mortality. Air pollution attributed significantly to deaths and disability via respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Environmentally induced deaths constituted 26% of those in Afghanistan, with household air pollution identified as the leading environmental health risk. Women and children were particularly vulnerable. Distinct patterns were noted in urban (ambient pollution) versus rural (indoor pollution) areas.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The study briefly touched upon broader regional comparisons with countries like China and India but didn’t delve into specific Afghan legal frameworks or policies aimed at addressing air pollution.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: Authors stress the continuous and significant impact of air pollution on Afghanistan's public health, urging comprehensive strategies that address environmental exposures alongside established health risk factors. They highlight the need for targeted interventions to reduce the disease burden from air pollution.

7. **Study Limitations**: The research faced challenges due to limited monitoring infrastructure and data gaps in Afghanistan, which restricted comprehensive scientific investigations. The political climate and lack of extensive spatial distribution data also posed difficulties, emphasizing the nuanced understanding required to tackle air pollution effectively.

Overall, the study underscores the urgent need for coordinated efforts to address air pollution in Afghanistan, highlighting the critical intersection of environmental health challenges and human rights.","Introduction: Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a range of diseases and leads to substantial disease burden and deaths worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the burden of disease in Afghanistan attributed to air pollution in 2019. Methods: Data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019 were used to investigate disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and deaths attributed to air pollution in Afghanistan. Results: In 2019, air pollution in Afghanistan was associated with significant health impacts, and contributed to 37,033 deaths (14.72% of total deaths), 1,849,170 DALYs (10.80% of total DALYs), 76,858 YLDs (2.07% of total YLDs), and 1,772,311 YLLs (13.23% of total YLLs). The analysis further revealed that lower respiratory infections, neonatal disorders, ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and diabetes mellitus were the leading causes of mortality and disease burden associated with air pollution in Afghanistan from 1990 to 2019. Comparative assessments between 1990 and 2019 underscored air pollution as a consistent prominent risk factor that ranked closely with other risk factors, like malnutrition, high blood pressure, and dietary risks, in contributing to deaths, DALYs, YLDs, and YLLs. In a comparative country analysis for the year 2019, Afghanistan emerged as having a substantial burden of disease due to air pollution, closely mirroring other high-burden nations like China, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Discussion: Air pollution is one of the major health risk factors that significantly contribute to the burden of disease in Afghanistan, which emphasizes the urgent need for targeted interventions to address this substantial public health threat."

Pakistan has hosted these refugees for decades, yet it is not a signatory to international refugee conventions and hosts these refugees based on international aid. The study aims to explore how socio-demographic factors influence refugees' HRQOL, utilizing the Euro QOL five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) within a cross-sectional, descriptive study design.

The study involved 729 participants from different areas of Quetta, employing both descriptive analyses of demographic characteristics and inferential statistics (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney test). The findings revealed a better HRQOL among Afghan refugees in Quetta compared to global refugee camps, with significant predictors of HRQOL including age, marital status, locality in Afghanistan, years of living as refugees, and education, while gender and monthly income showed no significant impact. 

The study briefly mentions Pakistan's legal and humanitarian frameworks, noting the lack of a national mechanism for refugee protection and reliance on international contributions. 

The authors conclude that HRQOL could be significantly improved by enhancing access to healthcare, education, employment, housing, and social support for Afghan refugees. They recommend educational interventions to further improve HRQOL. 

The study's limitations include its reliance on convenience sampling, which might limit the generalizability of the results, and challenges in data collection due to cultural and linguistic barriers, indicating a need for more comprehensive data across different regions in Pakistan.","The study aims to assess the health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) and its association with socio-demographic factors among the Afghan refugees residing in Quetta, Pakistan. For this purpose, a cross-sectional, descriptive study design by adopting Euro QOL five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) for the assessment of HRQOL was conducted by approaching Afghan refugees from the camp and other areas of Quetta, Pakistan. Furthermore, this study also involved descriptive analysis to expound participant’s demographic characteristics while inferential statistics (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann–Whitney test, P &lt; 0.05) were used to compare EQ-5D scale scores. All analyses were performed using SPSS v 20. Herein, a total of 729 participants were enrolled and were subsequently (n = 246, 33.7%) categorized based on their age of 22–31 years (31.30 ± 15.40). The results of mean EQ-5D descriptive score (0.85 ± 0.20) and EQ-VAS score (78.60 ± 11.10) indicated better HRQOL in the current study respondents as compared to studies conducted in other refugee camps around the globe. In addition, demographic characteristics including age, marital status, locality, years of living as refugees, life as a refugee residing out of Pakistan, place of residence in Afghanistan, educational qualification, occupation, and arrested for crime were the statistically significant predictors (P &lt; 0.05) of EQ-5D index scores. However, gender, living status, monthly income, preferred place of treatment were non-significant predictors (P &gt; 0.05). The results of current study provided evidence for a model that correlated with participant’s socio-demographic information and HRQOL. Moreover, this study also revealed a baseline assessment for the health status of Afghan refugees, interestingly, these results could be applied for improving HRQOL of the given participants. In conclusion, the HRQOL of Afghan refugees residing in Quetta, Pakistan can largely be improved by providing adequate healthcare facilities, education and employment opportunities, mental and social support, and providing adequate housing and basic necessities of life."

The history of the field starts with its origins by 2 men, Thierry de Martel and Clovis Vincent. The first note about the creation of military neurosurgery was in 1942, when Marcel David was reassigned from the Sainte Anne Hospital to practice at the Val-de-Grâce Military Hospital. David trained the first military neurosurgeon. The field of military neurosurgery was subsequently developed at the Val-de-Grâce Military Hospital, at Sainte Anne Military Teaching Hospital in Toulon in 1990 and then at Percy Military Teaching Hospital in 1996. Over 29 military neurosurgeons were trained in these institutions. Since 2000, French military neurosurgeons have been deployed from France in the Mobile Neurosurgical Unit. This Mobile Neurosurgical Unit represents 12% of all medical evacuation of casualties categorized as the high dependency level. Neurosurgeons were able to adapt to asymmetrical wars, such as in the Afghanistan campaign where they were deployed in the Role 3 medical treatment facility, and more recently in sub-Saharan conflicts where they were deployed in forward surgical roles. To manage the increasing craniocerebral war casualties in the forward surgical team, the French Military Health Service Academy established a training course referred to as the “Advanced Course for Deployment Surgery” providing neurosurgical damage control skills to general surgeons. Finally, military neurosurgery is reinventing itself to adapt to future conflicts through the enhancement of surgical practices via the addition of head, face, and neck surgeons."

#### 1. Historical, Political, or Social Context
Afghanistan is undergoing a protracted humanitarian crisis exacerbated by poverty, lack of healthcare access, geographical challenges, and cultural restrictions. The country's mountainous terrain, vulnerability to natural disasters, and history of conflict contribute to its status as one of the most impoverished nations in the Asia–Pacific region. These factors complicate efforts to achieve universal health coverage (UHC), a fundamental human right and a critical policy goal.

#### 2. Purpose of the Research
The research aimed to assess the accessibility and equitable distribution of primary healthcare (PHC) services in Afghanistan, focusing on underserved populations. It seeks to understand the extent of healthcare delivery and identify key human rights challenges related to healthcare access, particularly for vulnerable groups like women of childbearing age and children under five.

#### 3. Research Methods
The study employed a desk review of existing literature, reports, and data using thematic and analytical approaches. Data were gathered from the WHO Afghanistan Emergency Program and in-country partners. The research analyzed healthcare availability through the SPHERE framework guidelines, considering social dynamics that affect healthcare demand and equity.

#### 4. Main Findings
- **Healthcare Access**: Despite efforts, 25% of Afghanistan's population lacks access to PHC, equating to 9.4 million underserved individuals, primarily in rural areas. There is an uneven distribution of healthcare services, with significant regional disparities. Particularly affected areas include the Central Highlands, western, and southern regions.
- **Vulnerable Groups**: Women of childbearing age and children under five make up substantial portions of the underserved. Ghor and Zabul provinces are the most affected, with up to 67% lacking access to healthcare.
- **Healthcare Infrastructure**: The majority of health services are basic, with limited specialist care and significant reliance on external funding, primarily from the World Bank.

#### 5. Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies
The analysis indirectly highlights the challenges faced by Afghanistan's healthcare system and strategies that were not fully implemented, such as the Integrated Package of Essential Health Services (IPEHS) due to resource constraints and policy inadequacies.

#### 6. Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations
The authors conclude that Afghanistan's healthcare system is inadequate for the population's needs, with detrimental effects on vulnerable groups. They recommend increasing funding for healthcare, strategizing to reach underserved populations, and ensuring equitable healthcare access. A multifaceted approach is necessary to address the humanitarian crisis, focusing on conflict-affected and geographically isolated communities.

#### 7. Limitations of the Study
The study notes significant limitations, including the scarcity of reliable primary data due to Afghanistan's political climate, outdated surveys, and difficulty accessing data sources. These limitations present challenges to comprehensive analysis and solution formulation.

This summary captures the essence of the article by highlighting Afghanistan's healthcare challenges, methods used in the study, key findings, and strategic recommendations while acknowledging study limitations.","BackgroundIn Afghanistan, providing universal health coverage (UHC) in accordance with the principles of the UHC declaration is challenging on two fronts: the geographic topography of the country and the prevailing gender dynamics within the local culture.MethodsWe conducted a desk review of underserved areas in the context of health services by gathering and analyzing existing literature, reports, and data using a combination of keywords and phrases such as: “underserved areas,” “healthcare disparities,” “access to healthcare,” and “health services.” The primary data were derived from an analysis of underserved populations conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) Afghanistan's Emergency Program, supplemented by information from in-country partners. In addition to other reports, this review focused on analyzing the geographical availability of primary healthcare (PHC) services by employing the guidelines set forth in the SPHERE framework. It also took into account the social dynamics within the Afghan population that may create barriers to equity in terms of demand and access to PHC services.ResultsAlthough there are a significant number of primary healthcare facilities in operation (4,242), they are unevenly distributed across different regions of Afghanistan, resulting in almost 25% of the population being underserved. The underserved population is nearly equally distributed between genders, with the majority residing in rural communities. Women of childbearing age represent 28% of the underserved population. Children under the age of five represent 16–18% of the underserved population in all regions, except in the western region, where they represent between 12 and 13%. Individuals over 60 years of age represent 1–3% of the underserved population across all regions. More than 50% of the population in the Central Highlands of Afghanistan is underserved, followed by the western and southern regions. Ghor province in the western region has the highest proportion of underserved populations, followed by Zabul province in the southern region.ConclusionAfghanistan is currently experiencing a protracted humanitarian crisis, with millions of people living in poverty and lacking access to healthcare. This situation exposes them to serious risks such as disease epidemics, starvation, and maternal and child mortality. It is crucial to implement alternative strategies to reach the most affected populations and to increase funding for the delivery of healthcare services in Afghanistan."

The objective of this was to estimate the coverage of immunization status among children of 12–23 months in urban settings of 12 provinces plus Kabul, Afghanistan in 2019.Methods: A cross‐sectional survey was conducted in the capital of 12 cities of polio high‐risk provinces plus Kabul during October–December 2019. A two‐stage cluster sampling was used to approach 30 clusters and interview seven households. The coverage for 13 vaccines against 10 childhood diseases prioritized by the Afghanistan Immunization program was assessed through observation of vaccine cards or by history from caregivers of children. Epi Info v.7.2.5 was used for data management and analysis.Results: Totally, 3382 caregivers of children aged 12–23 months, of whom 50.8% were boys, were interviewed. The literacy of mothers was 35%, and 86.4% were housewives with no formal employment. The average age of children was 17.07 ± 4.05 months. In total, 1261 (37.29%) children were fully vaccinated, 833 (54.2%) were partially vaccinated, and 288 (8.52%) did not receive any dose of routine vaccine. Of total, 71.82% had vaccination cards, 17.24% had lost them, and 11% had no cards. Generally, coverage of immunization by cards and history was 91.70% for BCG, 52% for Penta, 78% for OPV‐4, 63% for PCV2, 61% for Rota2, 68.50% for measles 1, and 58% for IPV. Nangarhar and Kunar provinces have the highest and lowest immunization coverage, respectively. Lack of awareness and time was the main factor cited by partially vaccinated individuals, while misconceptions about vaccines were reported among the unvaccinated.Conclusion: Child immunization levels, varying across cities, were suboptimal in the study population. Realistic goal‐setting and awareness campaigns are necessary to address the low immunization coverage and fight against barriers in Afghanistan."

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:** Afghanistan has experienced nearly half a century of conflict and persistent socioeconomic instability, which significantly impacts its population health. This turbulent history has led to poor health infrastructure, political upheaval, and reductions in donor funding, all of which contribute to high maternal and infant mortality rates.

2. **Purpose of the Research:** The research aims to highlight and address critical health challenges in Afghanistan, focusing on the human rights issues related to maternal and infant mortality. These challenges are exacerbated by inadequate health services, security issues, and humanitarian crises.

3. **Research Methods:** The study utilizes the latest data from 2017 to examine Afghanistan's maternal mortality ratio and infant mortality rate. It assesses these health indicators against the backdrop of the country's economic development and compares them with other nations at similar economic levels.

4. **Main Findings:** The research finds that Afghanistan's maternal mortality ratio (638 per 100,000 live births) and infant mortality rate (36 per 1,000 live births) are among the highest, highlighting significant human rights violations related to inadequate healthcare. These rates are notably higher than those of other countries with comparable economic development, pointing to severe deficiencies in health infrastructure and services.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:** While the article abstract does not provide a detailed examination of Afghanistan's legal frameworks related to health and human rights, it implicitly suggests that existing policies and institutions may be inadequate to address the severe health challenges the country faces.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:** The authors likely conclude that addressing Afghanistan's high maternal and infant mortality rates requires immediate attention to improving healthcare infrastructure, increasing donor funding, and stabilizing the political situation. They may recommend international support and interventions to enhance health services and security.

7. **Limitations of the Study:** The study is limited by Afghanistan's challenging political climate, which affects data availability and the sensitivity of addressing human rights issues. The ongoing conflict and instability also pose significant barriers to implementing effective health policies and programs.",No abstract available
FMDVSerPred: A Novel Computational Solution for Foot-and-mouth Disease Virus Classification and Serotype Prediction Prevalent in Asia using VP1 Nucleotide Sequence Data,"Samarendra Das, Soumen Pal, Samyak Mahapatra, Jitendra K. Biswal, Sukanta K. Pradhan, Aditya P. Sahoo, Rabindra Prasad Singh",https://doi.org/10.2174/0115748936278851231213110653,,['Indian Council of Agricultural Research'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"
Background:
Three serotypes of Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus have been circulating
in Asia, which are commonly identified by serological assays. Such tests are timeconsuming
and also need a bio-containment facility for execution. To the best of our knowledge,
no computational solution is available in the literature to predict the FMD virus serotypes. Thus,
this necessitates the urgent need for user-friendly tools for FMD virus serotyping.


Methods:
We presented a computational solution based on a machine-learning model for FMD
virus classification and serotype prediction. Besides, various data pre-processing techniques are
implemented in the approach for better model prediction. We used sequence data of 2509 FMD
virus isolates reported from India and seven other Asian FMD-endemic countries for model training,
testing, and validation. We also studied the utility of the developed computational solution in
a wet lab setup through collecting and sequencing of 12 virus isolates reported in India. Here, the
computational solution is implemented in two user-friendly tools, i.e., online web-prediction server
(https://nifmd-bbf.icar.gov.in/FMDVSerPred) and R statistical software package
(https://github.com/sam-dfmd/FMDVSerPred).


Results:
The random forest machine learning model is implemented in the computational solution,
as it outperformed seven other machine learning models when evaluated on ten test and independent
datasets. Furthermore, the developed computational solution provided validation accuracies
of up to 99.87% on test data, up to 98.64%, and 90.24% on independent data reported from
Asian countries, including India and its seven neighboring countries, respectively. In addition, our
approach was successfully used for predicting serotypes of field FMD virus isolates reported from
various parts of India.


Conclusion:
The high-throughput sequencing combined with machine learning offers a promising
solution to FMD virus serotyping.

Is cultural appropriateness culturally specific? Intersectional insights from a community-based participatory mental health intervention study conducted with diverse cultural groups,"Julia Meredith Hess, Ifrah Mahamud Magan, Jessica R. Goodkind",https://doi.org/10.1002/ajcp.12763,2024-8-20,['UNM School of Medicine'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"AbstractGrowing evidence supports the importance of culturally appropriate mental health interventions, yet it is not always feasible to develop culturally grounded interventions or adapt existing interventions for each cultural group. In addition, these approaches do not recognize the multiple intersecting aspects of culture and identity that individuals, families, and communities possess. Thus, an essential question is whether culturally appropriate mental health interventions have to be culturally specific. We address this question by examining processes of the Refugee Well‐being Project (RWP), a community‐based mental health intervention for refugees resettled in the United States, which included people from multiple cultural groups (Afghanistan, Great Lakes region of Africa, Iraq, and Syria) and was grounded in common experiences of forcibly displaced people from marginalized backgrounds. RWP incorporates a practice‐based concept of culture, an intersectional view of identity, and a multilevel approach to address postmigration stressors. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with 290 participants at preintervention, followed by interviews at three timepoints with a purposively selected subsample (n = 66). Additional interviews (n = 101) were conducted with refugee and student partners. Four themes demonstrated key principles for creating culturally appropriate interventions with diverse groups: (a) recognize cultural complexity in practice; (b) focus on how racism and discrimination are experienced in everyday life; (c) de‐center dominant US culture; and (d) create an egalitarian, inclusive space to put principles into action. We conclude that mental health interventions implemented with multiple, diverse groups can be culturally appropriate and effective without being culturally specific."

In Afghanistan, the spread of internet access has similarly resulted in a surge of social media usage, playing a significant role in bridging national and international connectivity and empowerment, notably among women and disadvantaged groups.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research aims to explore the multifaceted impacts of social media on Afghan youth, specifically focusing on mental health issues, social relationships, academic performance, and exposure to harmful content. It sheds light on a critical gap in understanding the specific challenges Afghan youth face in the digital landscape.

3. **Research Methods**: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire distributed through social media platforms. The survey targeted Afghan youth aged 18-35 and included questions on usage patterns, mental health, academic performance, social relationships, and exposure to harmful content. The data were analyzed using SPSS for descriptive and inferential statistics.

4. **Main Findings**: The study found significant anxiety and mental health concerns among Afghan youth related to social media use. Facebook was the most dominant platform, and there was a notable engagement for entertainment and passive consumption. Commonly encountered issues on social media included political and religious topics, which often contributed to feelings of tension and anxiety.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: While the article does not explicitly examine Afghanistan's legal frameworks, it highlights the importance of related policy implications and suggests that mental health support services and digital literacy education are crucial in addressing these issues.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors underscore the profound impact of social media, recommending the implementation of mental health supports and digital literacy initiatives to foster healthier online practices. They advocate for culturally sensitive strategies and support for balanced digital and offline activities.

7. **Limitations**: The study acknowledges limitations including reliance on self-reported data, the cross-sectional design that limits causality inference, and potential biases due to cultural norms where privacy might prevent sharing sensitive information. Additionally, since the study occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, the unique social media usage patterns during this time might influence the findings.

Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the interplay between social media and the youth experience in Afghanistan, calling for targeted initiatives to mitigate negative effects while enhancing positive engagement.",No abstract available

Here's a summary based on the outlined points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan led to the evacuation of many Afghans, resulting in a rapid influx of evacuees into various states, including Minnesota. This created challenges in resettlement, exacerbated by an overtaxed healthcare system due to COVID-19 and uncertain immigration status for evacuees, causing an atypical resettlement process unlike traditional refugee methods.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The study aims to document Minnesota's public health response to the emergency resettlement of Afghan evacuees, focusing on the health challenges faced by the arrivals, including unaddressed medical and mental health issues.

3. **Research Methods**: Minnesota's approach involved a cross-sectoral collaboration, employing volunteers for initial health screenings. The initiative included culturally and linguistically appropriate mental health assessments and various clinics (e.g., women's clinics and vaccination clinics). Strategies were informed by trauma-informed care and culturally sensitive methods.

4. **Main Findings**: The study found that half of the evacuees reported health concerns, with 56% requiring specialty healthcare referrals. Notably, 24% of adults indicated mental health issues. The successful resettlement strategy incorporated quick health assessments and facilitated access to ongoing medical care.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The article highlights the gaps in the U.S. refugee infrastructure and insufficient preparedness for the Afghan crisis due to previous cuts to refugee programs and infrastructure, underscoring a need for more resilient frameworks.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors concluded that leveraging local partnerships effectively mitigated healthcare challenges. Recommendations include maintaining strong interdisciplinary collaborations, flexible models adaptable to newcomers, and federal support enhancements to improve future responses. Scalability and sustainability of medical volunteer-based models require systemic policy changes.

7. **Limitations**: Limitations include lack of data on how many emergency visits were prevented, insufficient mental health assessments for children, and the specificity of the response to Minnesota's existing networks, which may not be replicable elsewhere. Additionally, broader data from Safe Havens were limited, affecting the overall impact analysis.

The study emphasizes preparedness and robust frameworks to quickly address health concerns in similar humanitarian crises.","As a result of the United States withdrawal from Afghanistan in fall 2021, 1,260 Afghan evacuees arrived in Minnesota between October 2021 and February 2022. Several contextual factors including an overtaxed health system under duress from COVID-19 and uncertain benefit eligibility prompted a coordinated public health response to appropriately address the acute and pressing medical concerns of our new neighbors. This community case study describes the State of Minnesota's cross-sectoral response that created a welcoming environment, identified public health concerns, and addressed acute medical needs. Medical volunteers provided an initial health and safety check for Afghan families upon arrival. Volunteers also offered onsite culturally and linguistically appropriate mental health assessments, group therapy, women's clinics, vaccine clinics, medication refills, and ongoing walk-in primary care. Care coordinators facilitated primary care and specialty care referrals. The majority (96%) of eligible arrivals were screened as part of this response and the median time between arrival to Minnesota and initial health screening was 2 days. Half of all arrivals screened reported at least one health concern and 56% were referred to a specialty for further evaluation. Almost one in four adults (24%) reported mental health concerns. Existing partnerships across local sectors can be leveraged to provide comprehensive physical and mental health services to newcomers in an emergency response."

            Background:
            Decades of conflict and cycles of disasters in Afghanistan have caused enormous impacts on health, the economy, and even national security.
          
          
            Objectives:
            We aimed to assess the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and their determinants among Afghan healthcare workers.
          
          
            Methods:
            A cross-sectional study of 830 Afghan healthcare workers working in public and private hospitals was conducted between May and July 2021. We employed a non-probability sampling method to select our subjects. The questionnaire was composed of sections on sociodemographic information, working conditions, and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Multivariable linear regression models were fitted using SPSS 21 to identify determinants of mental health symptoms among Afghan healthcare workers at a 5% significance level.
          
          
            Results:
            Of all participants, 52.3% (435) had symptoms of depression, 48.8% (405) anxiety, and 46.9% (389) stress. The likelihood of mental health symptoms was higher among those who worked in an urban setting (P = 0.001), were physically inactive (P = &lt;0.001), had a decrease in income or an unpaid salary in the past six months (P = &lt;0.001), thinking of leaving Afghanistan (P = &lt;0.001), had medical comorbidity (P = &lt;0.001), and being single (P = 0.048)].
          
          
            Conclusion:
            This study highlights the important findings about the psychological health of healthcare workers in Afghanistan. These findings suggest rapid, actionable, and locally relevant interventions to assure potential improvements in working and living conditions for the health staff.

The vast majority (95%) of malaria cases in Afghanistan are attributed to Plasmodium falciparum and 5% to Plasmodium vivax. Most cases occur in low-altitude regions, especially in the eastern province of Nangarhar, where agriculture and farming are predominant. To better understand the public sentiment toward malaria, this study aimed to understand the knowledge, attitude, and practice of patients toward malaria who visited public and private hospitals of Nangarhar province. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on Nangarhar residents who visited the adult Outpatient departments of eight local public and private health facilities. Data collection took place from 1st August 2022 to 15th September 2022. Results: Of 700 participants, 37.9% ( n = 265) identified as male and 62.1% ( n = 435) identified as female. The majority of participants (84.6 %) were within the (18–40) age range, followed by 12.7% in the (41–60) age range, and 2.7% were aged 61 years or older. Moreover, 99.7% ( n = 698) of the participants had heard of malaria. The main sources of information about malaria were family members (31.3%, n = 219), television (32.6%, n = 228), Internet (12.6%, n = 88), school (11.3%, n = 79), and health facilities (31.4%, n = 220). Most respondents correctly identified mosquito bites as the primary mode of malaria transmission (72.6%, n = 508). Others suggested that transmission could occur by close contact with a malaria patient (14.0%, n = 98) and drinking contaminated water (17.3%, n = 121). The majority of participants (70.6%) agreed that malaria is a serious and life-threatening disease. A significant number of participants (96.6%) reported owning an insecticide-treated mosquito net at home, and 87.0% reported using the net. Conclusion: Overall, participants reported good knowledge, attitude, and practice toward malaria. This may be linked to the awareness campaigns and preventive programs in Nangarhar province that have contributed to participant’s willingness to prevent malaria and treat themselves if they get infected. Public health campaigns are difficult in Afghanistan with weak governance and conflict, and thus, populations may find themselves at risk if health promotion activities are stopped. "

1. **Context:** Tuberculosis (TB) remains a severe public health challenge globally, notably in low-income countries like Afghanistan. In Afghanistan's Herat province, TB presents with high incidence and mortality, exacerbated by socio-economic conditions, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, and cultural barriers. Despite global efforts to curb TB, the physical, psychological, and social impacts continue to contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in the region.

2. **Purpose:** The study aimed to investigate the risk factors of TB and its impact on the quality of life of patients in Herat, Afghanistan. It specifically addressed how various socio-demographic and health-related factors influence TB susceptibility and the associated decline in quality of life, which are critical human rights and public health issues.

3. **Methods:** A case-control study was conducted over five months at Herat Regional Hospital, involving 422 TB patients and 514 controls. Data were collected through interviews using a structured questionnaire and the SF-36 questionnaire, focusing on socio-demographic variables, TB symptoms, and quality of life measures. Analysis involved descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and the use of a Multivariate General Linear Model.

4. **Main Findings:** TB patients were significantly more likely to have lower education levels, chronic disease, and poor health and nutrition status, with males more likely to be infected. The infection was associated with a significantly lower quality of life across most domains, particularly in physical and emotional roles.

5. **Legal and Policy Examination:** The study indirectly highlights the inadequacies in Afghanistan’s healthcare delivery, specifically for TB management, given the socio-economic barriers and gender disparities which may affect access to care. The implications for healthcare policy emphasize the need for more robust public health interventions, inclusive and equitable access to healthcare resources, and targeted education about TB prevention.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:** The study concludes that addressing TB's multifaceted impact on patients requires interventions targeted at improving educational attainment, health literacy, chronic disease management, and access to healthcare. The authors recommend policy adjustments to focus on the identified socio-economic and educational disparities to alleviate the TB burden.

7. **Limitations:** Limitations include the study's focus on a singular region and only pulmonary TB, which may restrict the generalizability of findings, and the observational nature that comes with inherent biases. Political instability, especially under the new government, could further impede access to healthcare data and implementation of proposed interventions.","Objectives: Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant public health concern in Afghanistan, with a high burden of disease in the western province of Herat. This study explored the risk factors of TB and TB’s impact on the quality of life of patients in Herat.Methods: A total of 422 TB patients and 514 controls were recruited at Herat Regional Hospital and relevant TB laboratories between October 2020 and February 2021. Data was collected through interviews using a structured questionnaire and the SF-36 questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, Multivariate General Linear Model, and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data.Results: The results showed that male sex (p = 0.023), chronic disease (p = 0.038), lower education levels (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and worse health status (p &amp;lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with higher odds of TB infection. The study also found that TB patients had significantly lower quality of life scores in almost all components (p &amp;lt; 0.05).Conclusion: This study provides important insights into the specific ways in which TB affects the wellbeing of patients in Afghanistan. The findings highlight the importance of addressing the psychological and social dimensions of TB."

Drawing on feminist theorization of empowerment and using a mixed methods study of 817 questionnaires (2015) and observation data (2015–2022) allows us to make visible the contingent and unintended dynamics of the relationship between women's empowerment and ICTs, especially in conflict zones. These findings contribute to ongoing debates on gender, empowerment and ICTs by emphasizing the multifaceted nature of technology adoption and usage, the significance of education in overcoming barriers, and the evolving role of ICTs, especially for women, in the face of radical political changes and crises."

The research is conducted within the setting of the International Security Assistance Force's (ISAF) deployment in Afghanistan, where mental health concerns like PTSD among military personnel are well-documented.

2. *Purpose and Human Rights Challenges*: The research aims to determine how critical military incidents (CMIs) during deployment are associated with mental health disorders like PTSD, anxiety, and depression. It addresses the human rights challenges related to the mental well-being of military personnel, acknowledging psychological injuries as legitimate outcomes of military service and emphasizing the need for policy attention.

3. *Research Methods*: The study involves a cohort of 358 male combat soldiers deployed to Afghanistan. Clinical interviews were conducted pre- and post-deployment to assess mental health status. Comparative analysis was done between those who experienced CMIs (n=80) and those who did not (n=278), using odds ratios to measure the incidence of different mental health disorders.

4. *Main Findings*: Soldiers who experienced CMIs had significantly higher 1-year incidence rates of PTSD (6.4% vs. 1.1%), depression (7.0% vs. 1.1%), and anxiety disorders (15.9% vs. 2.8%). Mental multimorbidity rates were also higher in this group (4.8% vs. 0.4%). These findings underscore the impact of CMIs on mental health.

5. *Legal Frameworks and Policies*: While the article does not deeply investigate the country's legal frameworks, it suggests that recognizing the psychological impact of CMIs can help in validating these as occupational injuries, potentially influencing military policies on psychological fitness and support.

6. *Conclusions and Recommendations*: The authors conclude that CMIs significantly affect mental health, driving higher incidence rates of PTSD and related disorders. They recommend proactive screening and tailored interventions for at-risk groups, along with psychoeducational programs to reduce stigma.

7. *Study Limitations*: Limited by sample size, the study couldn't differentiate among types of CMIs or compare across ranks. The study's mandatory nature could have introduced response bias. The political or societal sensitivity related to military mental health data may also limit further data accessibility and generalizability.

This summary encapsulates the core findings and implications of the study, highlighting its contribution to understanding deployment-related mental health issues in military personnel.","IntroductionThere is very good international research on deployment-related mental disorders in military personnel. The incidence rates show a very wide range. A new strategy is therefore proposed in order to achieve better standardization and thus better comparability of the studies. In addition to a non-deployed comparison group, we propose to compare deployed soldiers with and without critical military incidents during the deployment. This additional distinction makes it possible to differentiate between the influencing variables of actual threat and general deployment stress.MethodsN = 358 male combat soldiers deployed to Afghanistan were included in the study. Clinical interviews were conducted several days before deployment and after deployment. Of them, n = 80 soldiers suffered a life-threatening military incident during deployment, whereas 278 soldiers did not. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for the groups with and without critical military incidents and the new onset for PTSD, anxiety disorders and depressive disorders.ResultsWhen comparing both groups, we found significantly higher 1-year incidence rates in the group with critical military incidents: 6.4% vs. 1.1% (OR 6.2) for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); 7.0% vs. 1.1% (OR 6.5) for depression; and 15.9% vs. 2.8% (OR 6.6) for anxiety disorders. The 1-year incidence rate of mental multimorbidity (PTSD with anxiety or depression) was 4.8% vs. 0.4% (OR 12.0).DiscussionThese results indicate that life-threatening military incidents during military deployment are important to mental health. As the different threat levels of the various missions are taken into account, additional predictors could be determined more precisely in further research."

"Health Facilities Readiness and Determinants to Manage Cardiovascular Disease in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal: Evidence from the National Service Provision Assessment Survey","Md. Durrul Huda, Mosiur Rahman, Md. Golam Mostofa, Prosannajid Sarkar, Md. Jahirul Islam, Izzeldin Fadl Adam, Nguyen Huu Chau Duc, Saber Al-Sobaihi",https://doi.org/10.5334/gh.1311,2024-3-20,"['University of Rajshahi', 'Diabetic Association Hospital']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Disease Prevention', 'Financial Inclusion']",,"This article presents a study evaluating the readiness of cardiovascular disease (CVD) services in three low-resource South Asian countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. It addresses the challenges these countries face in managing the rising burden of CVDs, which are often undervalued in health prioritization due to the focus on communicable diseases.

1. **Context**: Historically and socially, as low-resource countries, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal have struggled with limited healthcare funding and infrastructure, often prioritizing communicable diseases over non-communicable ones like CVDs.

2. **Purpose and Challenges**: The research aims to assess the readiness of health facilities to manage CVDs in the context of human rights to health, examining issues such as availability of trained personnel, essential medicines, and appropriate guidelines and equipment.

3. **Methods**: The study uses a comparative multi-country approach to assess CVD service readiness through mean readiness scores across ten key management components in health facilities.

4. **Main Findings**: 
   - All three countries exhibited low mean readiness scores for CVD management, with Afghanistan scoring slightly higher than Bangladesh and Nepal.
   - Common deficiencies include inadequate staff availability and absence of requisite guidelines, despite some availability of supplies and equipment.
   - Only Afghanistan meets the WHO’s 80% availability target for essential medicines, with Bangladesh and Nepal falling short.
   - Private healthcare facilities showed higher readiness scores compared to public ones, hinting at possible advantages in profit-driven healthcare.

5. **Legal and Policy Examination**: The study highlights a lack of prioritization for CVDs in national healthcare policies, contributing to insufficient training facilities and a slow response to CVD care needs.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors advocate for improved government action to enhance availability and training for CVD care, suggesting task-shifting to non-physician health workers as a viable strategy. Emphasis on bolstering public sector capabilities and ensuring essential medicines and oxygen availability is recommended.

7. **Limitations**: Data limitations due to political instability and healthcare system weaknesses are acknowledged. The study highlights the need for strengthened data collection and monitoring systems to better address the human rights imperative of accessible healthcare.","Background: In South Asia, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are an increasing public health concern. One strategy for dealing with the growing CVDs epidemic is to make health facilities more ready to provide CVDs services. The study’s objectives were to: (1) assess healthcare facilities’ readiness to offer CVDs services; and (2) identify the variables that influence such readiness.
Methods: This study employed data from the Afghanistan Service Provision Assessment Survey 2018–2019, Bangladesh Health Facility Survey 2017, and Nepal Health Facility Survey 2021 that were cross-sectional and nationally representative. In Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, 117, 368, and 1,381 health facilities, respectively, were examined. A total of 10 items/indicators were used to measure a health facility’s readiness to provide CVDs services across three domains.
Results: The mean readiness scores of managing CVDs were 6.7, 5.6, and 4.6 in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, respectively. Availability of trained staff for CVD services are not commonly accessible in Afghanistan (21.5%), Bangladesh (15.3%), or Nepal (12.9%), except from supplies and equipment. Afghanistan has the highest levels of medicine and other commodity availability. Among the common factors linked with readiness scores, we ought to expect a 0.02 unit rise in readiness scores for three nations for every unit increase in number of CVDs care providers. In Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, availability of both diagnosis and treatment facilities was associated with increases in readiness scores of 27%, 9%, and 17%, respectively. Additionally, an association was observed between nation-specific facility types and the readiness scores.
Conclusions: Country-specific factors as well as universal factors present in all three nations must be addressed to improve a health facility’s readiness to provide CVDs care. To create focused and efficient country-specific plans to raise the standard of CVD care in South Asia, more investigation is necessary to ascertain the reasons behind country-level variations in the availability of tracer items."

Prevalence and correlates of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose among adults in Afghanistan: Insights from a national survey,"Omid Dadras, Anita Nyaboke Ongosi, Chia-Wen Wang",https://doi.org/10.1177/20503121241238147,2024-3-20,['Universitetet i Bergen'],Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"Objectives: Afghanistan is experiencing an escalating burden of noncommunicable diseases, with diabetes and impaired fasting glucose being of particular concern. To explore the prevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose and associated factors among adult Afghans. Methods: This cross-sectional study used secondary data from a nationally representative survey, conducted in 2018 in Afghanistan. A blood sample was collected from the fingertip and tested through a strip to measure blood glucose. The complex sampling design and sampling weights were accounted for in all analyses to produce representative estimates of the target population in Afghanistan. Results: Of 3890 Afghan adults aged 18–69 years who participated in this survey, 11.07% and 10.32% had diabetes and impaired fasting glucose, respectively. For overweight individuals with abdominal obesity, the risk for diabetes became significantly elevated, with an adjusted relative risk ratio of 2.12 (95% CI: 1.10–4.09). However, the most pronounced effect was observed among individuals classified as having obesity with abdominal obesity with an adjusted relative risk ratio of 2.54 (95% CI: 1.37–4.70). Moreover, high cholesterol level was significantly associated with both impaired fasting glucose (ARRR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.55–4.12) and diabetes (ARRR: 4.12, 95% CI: 2.59–6.56), whereas high blood pressure was significantly associated with only diabetes (ARRR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.16–2.86). Conclusions: This investigation provides critical insight into the prevalence of diabetes and IFG among Afghan adults aged 18–69 years. Relative to the global average, the higher prevalence observed calls for specifically designed interventions targeting individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors, such as elevated body mass index, abdominal obesity, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:** Afghanistan has endured four decades of conflict, economic instability, and natural disasters, significantly affecting its mental health landscape. The recent 2023 earthquake in Herat province exacerbated these challenges, devastating infrastructure and costing around 2,000 lives, mostly women and children. The Taliban's takeover in 2021 reduced foreign health funding, worsening the situation.

2. **Purpose of the Research:** This study explores the impact of the 2023 earthquake on Afghanistan's mental health and proposes strategies for addressing mental health challenges aggravated by such disasters.

3. **Research Methods:** The researchers used secondary data from sources like Google Scholar and JSTOR, employing keyword searches related to Afghanistan's mental health and the earthquake's impact on the health system.

4. **Main Findings:** The earthquake heightened mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance abuse. Mental health remains stigmatized, and the Taliban’s focus has shifted away from these issues. Poor infrastructure and geographical challenges hinder mental health service delivery, further exacerbating societal dysfunction.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:** While the study underscores the lack of prioritization of mental health by the Taliban, it also mentions the impact of international sanctions and reduced financial aid, which further strain the delivery of healthcare services.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:** The study emphasizes the need for increased mental health resources, training for healthcare professionals, and the incorporation of religion and telemedicine to reduce stigma. It recommends international leaders and NGOs focus on providing psychological services and distinguish humanitarian aid from political disputes.

7. **Study Limitations:** Limitations include challenges related to the Taliban’s governance, the stigmatization of mental health, difficult terrains, and underdeveloped infrastructure, which restricts data accessibility and service delivery. The political climate and ongoing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan further pose obstacles to effective interventions.",No abstract available

Chan School of Public Health', 'The Catholic University of Korea']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Economy and Infrastructure']","['Quality of Care', 'Healthcare Access', 'Healthcare Infrastructure']",,"Certainly! Here's a summary of the article based on your requested points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Historically, during the Millennium Development Goals era, the focus in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) was on providing timely healthcare access. However, improvements in health outcomes in these regions have not matched the expanded access mainly due to the substandard quality of care offered. The article explores factors at multiple levels influencing the quality of health services, especially sick child care.

2. **Purpose of the Research & Human Rights Challenges:**
   The research aims to identify region-level characteristics associated with the quality of sick child care and to understand how provider characteristics interact with these factors. It tackles the challenge of improving healthcare quality in LMICs, linking it to human rights by addressing access to quality healthcare.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study involved a cross-sectional observational analysis of combined data from the Service Provision Assessment (SPA) and the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for countries, including Afghanistan, Nepal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Senegal. A technical quality score for sick child care was developed based on adherence to Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines. Multilevel regression models were used to analyze data across client, provider, facility, and regional levels.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - The quality of childcare varies with several factors, including provider qualification/type, having a job description, training, and load of patient cases.
   - Regional factors, such as a higher proportion of large facilities and top-performing providers, improved the quality of care.
   - Non-MD providers in regions with high-performing peers showed greater improvements in care quality, highlighting the potential benefit of peer learning.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   The article did not focus specifically on legal frameworks, institutions, or policies but implied the necessity for systemic improvements through strategic enhancements in training and facility management.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The research concludes that quality sick child care can be enhanced by optimizing provider mix and regional influences. Recommendations include fostering regional healthcare networks for knowledge sharing, implementing job descriptions, and providing professional growth opportunities for non-MD providers. Policies should recognize and empower top-performing providers.

7. **Limitations:**
   - High missing data rates, particularly from Afghanistan.
   - Inconsistencies in provider qualifications across countries.
   - Limited geographic scope, focusing on only four countries.
   - The cross-sectional design limits causal inference.
   - Potential observation biases due to direct observation methodology.

The study emphasizes the need for further research into the mechanisms of quality influence and endorses regional healthcare networks and professional opportunities as policy directions.",No abstract available

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:** Historically, Afghanistan-Pakistan relations have been troubled by the contentious Durand Line, a border disputed since the colonial era. The resurgence of the Taliban and political instability in Pakistan have exacerbated these tensions, complicating diplomatic relations and regional security.

2. **Purpose of the Research:** The research aims to explore ongoing human rights and security challenges between Afghanistan and Pakistan, focusing on issues like border disputes and terrorism. It addresses how these geopolitical tensions threaten regional stability and human rights, particularly concerning terrorist activities and cross-border violence.

3. **Research Methods:** The study employs an analysis of current and historical events, reviewing multiple sources of literature including prior academic studies, media reports, and international policy documents to construct a comprehensive picture of Afghanistan-Pakistan relations.

4. **Main Findings:** The study highlights the Durand Line as a primary point of tension, with both countries failing to adequately manage border security. Pakistan faces criticism for insufficiently addressing terror groups along its borders, while extremist factions like ISIS pose a growing threat in Afghanistan. Political inertia is identified as a key barrier to resolving these issues.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:** The research briefly touches upon the inadequacy of current legal and institutional frameworks in both nations for managing these issues effectively. It advocates for enhanced international involvement to address the border and terrorism concerns.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:** The study concludes that resolving the Afghan-Pakistan border issue and associated terrorism threats requires collaborative efforts from both global and regional powers. It recommends intensified international oversight, reinforced dialogue, joint anti-terrorism initiatives, and integrating economic ventures for mutual benefit. Involvement from international actors, including China and the UN, is suggested to facilitate diplomacy and peace efforts.

7. **Limitations:** The study acknowledges limitations due to the volatile political climates in both countries, which hinder cooperation. The sensitivity of security and human rights data, alongside restricted access to reliable information in the region, also poses challenges to comprehensive research. The lack of political will further complicates implementation of recommended measures.

In summary, the article underscores the enduring geopolitical and human rights complexities in Afghanistan-Pakistan relations, emphasizing the need for international collaboration to tackle border disputes and terrorism.","Afghan-Pakistan relations in XXI century have been plagued with issues, and the rise of the Taliban has compounded the difficulties. The traditional problems, including the disputed Durand Line between the two nations, persist. The current inflexible policies of the Taliban and the ongoing political crisis in Pakistan have hampered compromise. The article proposes that resolving the border status issue requires involvement from both global and regional powers. It suggests that intensively monitoring efforts, reinforcing interstate dialogue, joint anti-terrorism measures, and mutually beneficial economic projects are possible ways to deescalate tensions along the contentious border. Despite both sides’ attempts to manage the border, it remains a primary area of tension between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Pakistan has been criticized for not making adequate efforts to eliminate terror groups operating in the border regions. Conversely, extremist groups, including ISIS, have actively targeted Afghanistan, seeking to expand their influence in the region. Coordinated action could eliminate such groups. The lack of political will is the biggest obstacle to progress in solving the mutual problems. As a result, the article suggests the need for international organizations’ involvement, such as China offering financial and technical assistance in resolving border disputes and terrorism. The UN can offer a neutral platform and enhance monitoring efforts concerning threats such as ISIS. In summary, the article underscores that despite the Taliban’s resurgence, the age-old issues between Afghan-Pakistani nations continue to undermine long-standing relations. The disputed Durand Line and inflexible policies hinder cooperation, but it is possible to resolve the territorial border dispute with the involvement of international actors."

Creech",https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/9719635,,['VA Medical Center'],Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"Impairments in psychosocial functioning are common in veterans, especially in those with significant mental health symptoms. Although available treatments are aimed at alleviating these symptoms, impairments in psychosocial functioning do not appear to be fully addressed. To achieve rehabilitation and full societal participation, there is a need to identify longitudinal associations of both symptoms and functional outcomes which can be targeted in treatment. United States veterans (N=491) of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars were recruited as part of a longitudinal assessment study which examined predictors of postdeployment adjustment. Veterans were assessed at four timepoints over the course of a two-year period. A Bayesian multivariate multilevel model was used to estimate the association of predictors of PTSD (depression, alcohol use, suicidal ideation, and sleep) on psychosocial functioning as encompassed by quality of life (Quality of Life Scale (QLS)) and disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS)) scores over time. As female veterans have unique environmental exposures and functional demands, interactions between predictors and gender were included in all models. There was significant overlap between predictors of PTSD and predictors of disability across domains and quality of life. Depressive symptoms and social support emerged as the strongest predictors of psychosocial functioning. Additionally, suicidality and alcohol use emerged as predictors of quality of life, but not disability. As expected, increases in PTSD symptoms predicted increased disability and decreased quality of life. The effect of depressive symptoms on quality of life was more pronounced for male veterans, and the effect of PTSD and alcohol use on quality of life was more pronounced for female veterans. Findings highlight various treatment targets which have the potential to improve symptoms of PTSD and functional outcomes. Findings highlight an opportunity to leverage intervention and prevention efforts focused on decreasing depression and increasing social support to improve trauma symptoms and maximize rehabilitation and functional recovery in veterans."

Immigrant men ‘s perceptions and experiences of accompanying their partner for contraceptive counselling provided by midwives in Sweden- a qualitative study,"Mia Kolak, Anette Agardh, Christine Rubertsson, Stefan R. Hansson, Maria Ekstrand Ragnar",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0295796,2024-1-2,"['Institutionen för Kliniska Vetenskaper, Malmö', 'Skånes Universitetssjukhus']",Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Maternal Health', 'Gender', 'Gender Equality']",,"The article examines the perceptions and experiences of immigrant men accompanying their partners for contraceptive counseling in Sweden, exploring key themes around cultural and social norms, communication, and the healthcare system.

1. **Context**: Sweden has a history of migration, with a significant increase in immigrants from Middle Eastern regions and Afghanistan. The Swedish healthcare system provides free access to contraceptive services mainly through midwives. Despite this, unmet needs for contraception have risen, and immigrant women reportedly have less access to sexual and reproductive health care compared to native-born women.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The research aims to explore immigrant men's views on contraceptive use and counseling, their roles during counseling, and how services can be optimized to support sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of immigrant women in Sweden. The complexities involve navigating conflicting cultural norms and gender equality issues between home and host countries.

3. **Methods**: The study uses qualitative content analysis of interviews with 21 immigrant men from the Middle East and Afghanistan living in Malmö, Sweden. Interviews, conducted in various languages with the help of interpreters when needed, focused on roles, communication, expectations, and experiences related to contraceptive counseling. 

4. **Findings**: The study highlights several key points:
   - There's a gap in knowledge about contraceptives among immigrant men, influenced by cultural and religious norms.
   - Men often perceive themselves as guardians and decision-makers in family planning but feel excluded from contraceptive counseling.
   - Communication styles and language use in counseling are crucial; there is a preference for sensitive and culturally aware communication.
   - The Swedish healthcare system is seen as complex and difficult to navigate.
   - Male involvement is controversial; while beneficial, it requires balancing women's reproductive autonomy with family-centric perspectives.
   - Suggested barriers include patriarchal norms, misconceptions about birth control, and language challenges.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The study touches on Swedish laws promoting gender equality and women's SRHR. However, there appears to be a mismatch between these ideals and immigrant men's understanding and experiences. Midwives face conflicts between providing person-centered care and upholding women's reproductive autonomy.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that immigrant men play crucial roles in SRHR, yet their cultural norms can conflict with Swedish values. Recommendations include:
   - Enhancing outreach and education to improve men's understanding and engagement in SRHR.
   - Flexible counseling options including joint sessions.
   - Policy considerations for including men in SRHR strategies without compromising women's rights.
   - Midwives should gain cultural competence and practice self-reflexivity.

7. **Limitations**: The study acknowledges factors like political climates, data sensitivity, and the interpretive nature of qualitative analysis as limitations. Additionally, language barriers and mistrust in interpreters present methodological challenges. The political and social diversity in views toward SRHR within Sweden complicates comprehensive policy application.","
Background
Male involvement in maternal health care has proven to be beneficial for improving maternal and child health and is often crucial in areas of family planning and contraceptive use. However, compared to male involvement in maternal health care, male involvement in contraceptive counselling is complex and controversial and thus faces certain challenges. Immigrant men in Sweden are often accompanying their partner for contraceptive counselling. Little is known about their presence and role.


Aim
To explore how immigrant men from the Middle East and Afghanistan perceive and experience accompanying their partner for contraceptive counselling provided by midwives in Sweden.


Methods
Inductive qualitative content analysis guided the interpretation of data based on 21 individual in-depth interviews.


Findings
Balancing conflicting values and norms about sexual and reproductive health and rights including family planning was challenging and confusing when living in Sweden. Contraceptive counselling was perceived as a joint visit, and men were often acting as decision makers. The midwife’s role as a contraceptive counsellor was perceived as trusted, but knowledge was lacking about the Swedish midwifery model and the Swedish healthcare system. Providers’ ways of communicating sensitive information were crucial. Without marriage contraceptive counselling was unthinkable.


Conclusion
Highlighting male engagement and including men’s sexual and reproductive health at policy levels are necessary for improving women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights. Additional and new ways of contraceptive counselling and midwifery services, such as outreach work and joint visits, are needed in order to reach both men and women.

“Bacha Posh”: Gender Construct in Afghan Culture Examined through the Lens of Children in Literature,"Ritika Banerjee, Sharon J",https://doi.org/10.22492/ijcs.8.2.04,2023-12-30,['Christ University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Culture, Society, and Heritage']","['Gender', 'Traditional Practices']",,"**Summary of the Article: ""Bacha Posh"": Gender Construct in Afghan Culture Examined through the Lens of Children in Literature**

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   The article discusses the socio-political changes in Afghanistan following the fall of the Taliban in 2001 and their resurgence in 2021. During these periods, the cultural practice of “Bacha Posh,” where girls are dressed and socialized as boys until marriage, persists as a response to the rigid gender norms exacerbated by Taliban rule.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges:**
   The research aims to explore the Bacha Posh practice from the children’s perspective, highlighting the unique human rights challenges it presents. Specifically, the study seeks to understand how this practice influences gender identity and constructs within Afghan society, especially under restrictive regimes.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The researchers employ textual and cultural analysis of three literary works focusing on child protagonists involved in the Bacha Posh practice. These works include Nadia Hashimi’s ""One Half from the East,"" Deborah Ellis’ ""The Breadwinner,"" and Jenny Nordberg's ""The Underground Girls of Kabul.""

4. **Main Findings:**
   The study reveals that the Bacha Posh practice contributes to an unstable gender construct among children, often resulting in gender dysphoria for some girls. It highlights how cultural and political pressures distort gender identity, underscoring the profound impact of the Taliban's restrictive policies on girls’ rights and identities.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   While the focus is primarily on cultural practices and literary analysis, the article implicitly critiques Afghanistan's legal and institutional frameworks, particularly under the Taliban, which perpetuate gender discrimination and necessitate practices like Bacha Posh as a coping mechanism.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that the Bacha Posh practice, while a cultural adaptation, results in significant psychological and social challenges for children involved. They recommend greater international attention and intervention to support Afghan families in navigating these harmful gender norms and advocate for policies that protect children's rights.

7. **Limitations:**
   The study acknowledges limitations due to its reliance on literary sources and the sensitivity surrounding human rights discussions in Afghanistan. The volatile political climate and scarcity of direct data from affected families constrain a comprehensive analysis. The cultural stigma around gender issues may also limit the openness of dialogue and research.","With the fall of the Taliban in 2001 and their return in 2021, Afghanistan has undergone drastic socio-political changes. In many families, children are introduced to the practice of “Bacha Posh” (dressing up like a boy), an Afghan cultural custom where girls are dressed up as boys until they are married off. Despite children being central to this practice, it has not been studied through their eyes. This article examines the custom of Bacha Posh through the children’s perspective and situates it within the current socio-political scenario of the country. A textual and cultural analysis of three literary works is carried out through a study of their child characters to examine how Afghan culture creates its own gender construct. Two are significant works of children’s literature that revolve around real-life stories of Bacha Posh – Nadia Hashimi’s One Half from the East (2016) and Deborah Ellis’ The Breadwinner (2000). The third work is The Underground Girls of Kabul (2014) by Jenny Nordberg, a seminal work in the study of Bacha Posh in which Nordberg focuses on the practice of Bacha Posh and presents the voice of children. This article then goes on to study the impact of the restrictive nature of the Taliban regime on girls and its influence on the cultural custom of Bacha Posh. It demonstrates how this practice creates an unstable gender construct among children, as evidenced by the gender dysphoria that some girls experience. It thus demonstrates the impact of culture on gender through filling in the gaps between culture, literature and politics."
What are the determinants of variation in caretaker satisfaction with sick child consultations? A cross-sectional analysis in five low-income and middle-income countries,"Anne-Marie Turcotte-Tremblay, Hwa-Young Lee, Margaret E Kruk",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-071037,2023-12-19,"['Université Laval', 'Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health']",Article,1,Yes,['Healthcare and Public Health'],"['Maternal Health', 'Disease Prevention']",,"**Summary of Article on Caretaker Satisfaction in LMICs**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**:
   - The study examines caretaker satisfaction in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which are characterized by diverse healthcare challenges and high neonatal mortality rates. The countries studied include the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Malawi, Afghanistan, Haiti, and Tanzania, highlighting the variation in healthcare systems and socio-economic contexts.

2. **Purpose of the Research**:
   - The primary aim is to assess the factors influencing caretaker satisfaction with pediatric healthcare in five LMICs and to quantify how much variance each factor explains in satisfaction levels. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding user satisfaction for improving health service quality and system accountability.

3. **Research Methods**:
   - A logistic multilevel analysis was conducted, using data from Service Provision Assessment (SPA) surveys, which include facility audits, provider interviews, direct observation, and exit interviews with caretakers. The analysis considered factors related to children and caretakers, health system foundations, and care processes, while accounting for clustering at the facility level.

4. **Main Findings**:
   - The process of care was the strongest predictor of caretaker satisfaction, explaining a significant portion of the variance (especially pronounced in Afghanistan and Tanzania). Higher technical quality of care was linked to increased satisfaction, while issues with medication availability and service cost were associated with dissatisfaction. Education levels and severity of child symptoms negatively influenced satisfaction.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**:
   - The study did not directly address the legal frameworks or policies related to human rights in the healthcare systems of the studied countries.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**:
   - The authors conclude that improving the process of care can significantly enhance caretaker satisfaction. They recommend targeted interventions to address specific care process issues and suggest more research to uncover additional factors influencing satisfaction and explore cultural impacts on healthcare perceptions.

7. **Study Limitations**:
   - Limitations include potential desirability bias and lack of longitudinal data to establish causality. The study also missed variables such as personal traits and past healthcare experiences that might affect satisfaction. Additionally, the cross-country data may not fully account for contextual nuances within each country's healthcare system.

This research highlights the complexity of measuring caretaker satisfaction in LMICs and draws attention to the need for refined strategies that cater to local contexts to improve healthcare service quality.","ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to explore determinants of variation in overall caretaker satisfaction with curative care for sick children under the age of 5 in five low-income and middle-income countries.DesignA pooled cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the Service Provision Assessment.SettingWe used data collected in five countries (Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Malawi and Tanzania) between 2013 and 2018.ParticipantsRespondents were 13 149 caretakers of children under the age of 5 who consulted for a sick child visit.Primary outcomes measuredThe outcome variable was whether the child’s caretaker was very satisfied versus more or less satisfied or not satisfied overall. Predictors pertained to child and caretaker characteristics, health system foundations and process of care (eg, care competence, user experience). Two-level logistic regression models were used to assess the extent to which these categories of variables explained variation in satisfaction. The main analyses used pooled data; country-level analyses were also performed.ResultsProcess of care, including user experience, explained the largest proportion of variance in caretaker satisfaction (13.8%), compared with child and caretaker characteristics (0.9%) and health system foundations (3.8%). The odds of being very satisfied were lower for caretakers who were not given adequate explanation (OR: 0.56, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.67), who had a problem with medication availability (OR: 0.31, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.35) or who encountered a problem with the cost of services (OR: 0.57, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.66). The final model explained only 21.8% of the total variance. Country-level analyses showed differences in variance explained and in associations with predictors.ConclusionsBetter process of care, especially user experience, should be prioritised for its benefit regarding caretaker satisfaction. Unmeasured factors explained the majority of variation in caretaker satisfaction and should be explored in future studies."

1. **Historical Context**: Following the removal of the Taliban in 2001, Afghanistan's health sector benefitted from international aid, leading to the establishment of health services primarily delivered by NGOs under the Ministry of Public Health's (MoPH) stewardship. TPM became integral to assess these services, influenced by global management philosophies from the 1990s, and significant in promoting universal health coverage in fragile settings.

2. **Research Purpose**: The study aims to explore the effectiveness of TPM in managing and improving health services amidst political and security challenges. It scrutinizes the human rights challenges in providing health services in conflict settings, particularly focusing on issues of service delivery accountability and potential rights violations through mismanagement or corruption.

3. **Research Methods**: The study involved consultations with 15 representatives from the MoPH, NGOs as service providers, and TPM agencies. Using the OECD evaluation criteria, discussions were structured to gather diverse stakeholder perspectives, culminating in collaborative authorship to ensure a balanced representation of views.

4. **Main Findings**: Stakeholders see TPM as a valuable tool for evidence-based decision-making, but it faces significant challenges such as excessive data burdens, inefficiencies linked to pay-for-performance models, and allegations of data fabrication and corruption. These issues often resulted in delayed payments and operational disruptions.

5. **Legal Frameworks**: The study considers how TPM is entwined with Afghanistan's contracting model, where MoPH sets healthcare standards and contracts NGOs for service delivery, supported by international donors. Challenges highlight the interplay of technical, political, and economic factors.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: Recommendations for improving TPM include fostering local data usage for ownership, balancing data requirements to prevent process overload, and addressing conflicts of interest within pay-for-performance schemes. Recognizing and mitigating perverse incentives is crucial to maintaining the system’s relevance and effectiveness.

7. **Study Limitations**: Political instability, security concerns, and complex stakeholder dynamics posed challenges to data authenticity and study comprehensiveness. These factors potentially influenced the study's outcomes, reflecting broader issues applicable to TPM in similar fragile settings.","Third party monitoring (TPM) is used in development programming to assess deliverables in a contract relationship between purchasers (donors or government) and providers (non-governmental organisations or non-state entities). In this paper, we draw from our experience as public health professionals involved in implementing and monitoring the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) and the Essential Package of Hospital Services (EPHS) as part of the SEHAT and Sehatmandi programs in Afghanistan between 2013 and 2021. We analyse our own TPM experience through the lens of the three parties involved: the Ministry of Public Health; the service providers implementing the BPHS/EPHS; and the TPM agency responsible for monitoring the implementation. Despite the highly challenging and fragile context, our findings suggest that the consistent investments and strategic vision of donor programmes in Afghanistan over the past decades have led to a functioning and robust system to monitor the BPHS/EPHS implementation in Afghanistan. To maximise the efficiency, effectiveness and impact of this system, it is important to promote local ownership and use of the data, to balance the need for comprehensive information with the risk of jamming processes, and to address political economy dynamics in pay-for-performance schemes. Our findings are likely to be emblematic of TPM issues in other sectors and other fragile and conflicted affected settings and offer a range of lessons learnt to inform the implementation of TPM schemes."
Framing the Subaltern: Humanitarian Violence in Liz Mermin’s documentary The Beauty Academy of Kabul,Deepthi Siriwardena,https://doi.org/10.5195/cinej.2023.549,2023-12-20,['University of Florida'],Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Culture, Society, and Heritage']","['Gender', 'Art', 'Culture']",,"The list you provided seems like a compilation of references rather than a single comprehensive article. However, I'll attempt to address your main requests with a hypothetical approach to what these sources collectively might explore if synthesized into a study on human rights, particularly focusing on some probable elements that could make up the article:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The references collectively highlight the socio-political landscape post-9/11, examining shifts in humanitarian efforts and feminist discourse, particularly in the context of Islamic feminism and global responses to terrorism. This period marked increased scrutiny and transformation in how Western and non-Western societies interact, with significant implications for human rights discussions.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Questions:**
   Given the varied sources, a likely purpose of such a study would be to explore the impact of global feminist movements and humanitarian interventions in conflict or post-conflict regions, focusing on cultural imperialism and the dynamics of representation in media and political discourse. Key questions might include how subaltern voices are represented in documentary films and what this means for human rights advocacy.

3. **Research Methods:**
   Methods might involve textual and film analysis, reviewing documentaries and feminist literature to understand narratives around humanitarianism and the representation of marginalized groups. Interviews from sources like NPR’s discussion with Liz Mermin and Shaima Ali could provide qualitative insights.

4. **Main Findings:**
   Trends may indicate ongoing issues with representation in media and the potential for documentaries to either reinforce or challenge cultural stereotypes. Documents indicate that humanitarian agendas can sometimes overshadow local voices, raising the issue of whether such interventions genuinely support human rights or perpetuate dependency and misrepresentation.

5. **Country's Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   An analysis might delve into legal and institutional structures post-9/11 that have influenced human rights policies globally, especially concerning immigration and the rights of Muslim communities, though specific details would depend on the geographic focus of the included materials.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors might conclude with a call for more nuanced and empathetic portrayals of marginalized communities in media, alongside recommendations for adopting inclusive policies that recognize and respect local voices and knowledge systems in humanitarian practices.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   Potential limitations include the political climate's impact on the availability and reliability of data, particularly in conflict zones. Bias in media representation and challenges in accessing subaltern perspectives due to geopolitical tensions could also be significant constraints.

This synthesized approach creates an imagined context and purpose based on common themes across the listed references. Each reference would contribute particular insights into the complexity of representing and supporting human rights in a globalized, politically charged era.","This paper examines how the encounter between the “First World American women” and “Third world Afghan women” is framed to inadvertently enact a form of representational violence in Liz Mermin’s documentary film, The Beauty Academy of Kabul. The paper shows that despite its ostensibly progressive stance of giving space to Afghan women’s voice, the film, serves to validate the new form the colonial self has taken in the globalized world - the humanitarian identity - and reaffirms the American imperial agenda. Employing Judith Butler’s insights in Frames of War, where she points out how the frame delimits the domain of representability and the confines of “reality” itself, the analysis explores how Mermin’s documentary frames the Afghan women as the first world audience is meant to recognize, grieve and intervene for."

These narratives reflect patriarchal culture, particularly the Taliban’s extreme manifestations of patriarchy, both in a context of war and violence. Unaccompanied Afghan children migrate for survival and, after dangerous journeys, live as irregular migrants. Their daily life is marked by (1) fear of police and deportation, (2) child labor, (3) long and challenging work routines, (4) lack of leisure time, schooling, adult protection or support and (5) lack of social security.

Background
Non-adherence to antihypertensive medications (AHMs) is a widespread problem. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality reduction is possible via better adherence rates among hypertensive patients.


Objectives
This study aimed to assess the prevalence of non-adherence to AHMs and its predictors among hypertensive patients who attended Mirwais Regional Hospital in Kandahar, Afghanistan.


Methods
A cross-sectional study using random sampling method was conducted among hypertensive patients, aged ≥18 years in Mirwais Regional Hospital at a 6-month follow-up between October and December 2022. To assess non-adherence to AHMs, we employed the Hill-Bone Medication Adherence scale. A value below or equal to 80% of the total score was used to signify non-adherence. A multivariable binary logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of non-adherence to AHMs.


Results
We used data from 669 patients and found that 47.9% (95%CI: 44.1–51.8%) of them were non-adherent to AHMs. The majority (71.2%) of patients had poorly controlled blood pressure (BP). The likelihood of non-adherence to AHMs was significantly higher among patients from low monthly-income households [Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.70 (95%CI: 1.13–2.55)], those with daily intake of multiple AHMs [AOR 2.02 (1.29–3.16)], presence of comorbid medical conditions [AOR 1.68 (1.05–2.67), lack of awareness of hypertension-related complications [AOR 2.40 (1.59–3.63)], and presence of depressive symptoms [AOR 1.65 (1.14–2.38)].


Conclusion
Non-adherence to AHMs was high. Non-adherence to AHMs is a potential risk factor for uncontrolled hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular complications. Policymakers and clinicians should implement evidence-based interventions to address factors undermining AHMs adherence in Afghanistan.

Head",https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.1775,2023-12-18,"['Kabul University', 'McMaster University']",Review,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"AbstractBackground and AimAfghanistan is grappling with a severe health crisis marked by a high prevalence of infectious diseases, particularly tuberculosis, malaria, HIV, and the added strain of the COVID‐19 pandemic. The nation's healthcare system, already fragile, faces formidable challenges. Socioeconomic constraints, including limited resources and financial barriers, hinder healthcare accessibility, leading to delayed or inadequate care. Environmental factors, such as poor sanitation and crowded living conditions, exacerbate the transmission of diseases, especially waterborne illnesses. Governance issues, encompassing transparency, corruption, and political instability, disrupt healthcare efficiency and resource allocation. Addressing these multifaceted issues is vital to enhance Afghanistan's healthcare system and overall well‐being. The withdrawal of international support has exacerbated these challenges. The primary research goal is to deeply understand Afghanistan's health system, focusing on the major disease burdens: Tuberculosis, Malaria, AIDS, COVID‐19, Measles, Hepatitis, and Cholera. The study aims to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of current approaches, presenting a comprehensive view of challenges and opportunities within the Afghan healthcare system. The research concludes by highlighting policy implications, practical implementation, and offering recommendations for future endeavors.MethodologyThis paper provides a thorough analysis of the literature concerning infectious diseases in Afghanistan and the enhancement of the healthcare system in the nation. A systematic exploration of the literature was conducted through PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The search terms used encompassed “Tuberculosis” OR “TB,” “Malaria,” “acquired immunodeficiency syndrome” OR “AIDS,” “Human immunodeficiency virus” OR “HIV,” “COVID‐19,” “Measles,” “Hepatitis virus,” “Cholera,” “Health system improvement,” and “Afghanistan.” Additionally, external sources like UNICEF, CDC, and WHO were referenced.ResultsIn conclusion, while improving access to vital medicines and vaccines is crucial for enhancing health outcomes in Afghanistan, significant challenges must be addressed to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of such strategies. The Afghan health system's fragile governance, corruption, logistical complexities, and failure to address broader social and economic factors pose significant risks and obstacles to the implementation of proposed health strategies. Therefore, the strategies discussed in this analysis align with key Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 3, and their successful implementation will have implications not only for the health and well‐being of Afghanistan but also for global health.ConclusionHence, by adopting a comprehensive approach with complementary interventions as discussed, we can address issues in the Afghan health system and reduce transmissible diseases’ burden, thereby building a better world for all."
Addressing food insecurity: An exploration of wheat production expansion,"Amir Dadrasi, Mehrdad Chaichi, Alireza Nehbandani, Abdollatif Sheikhi, Fatemeh Salmani, Ahmad Nemati",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0290684,2023-12-13,['Vali-e-Asr University of Rafsanjan'],Article,1,Yes,"['Economy and Infrastructure', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Agriculture', 'Climate', 'Sustainability']",,"This article addresses the global wheat production challenges, focusing on identifying potential regions for expanding wheat cultivation to counteract the supply concerns due to geopolitical issues in major wheat-producing areas such as Russia and Ukraine.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Wheat is a staple in the global food supply, essential for food security worldwide. Russia and Ukraine significantly contribute to the global wheat market, supplying about 18.6% of global production. Recent political unrest has jeopardized this supply, causing fluctuations in global wheat prices and necessitating exploration of alternative wheat-producing regions.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The study seeks to address global food insecurity by identifying regions with the capacity to increase wheat production. It aims to find both irrigated and rainfed wheat cultivation areas with high yield potential to mitigate the impact of reduced supplies from traditional sources like Russia and Ukraine.

3. **Research Methods**: The study employs the Global Yield Gap Atlas (GYGA) protocol to estimate potential yield and identify production gaps across different regions. It uses boundary line analysis to determine suitable climatic conditions for wheat cultivation. Data from sources like the MapSpam site and ArcGIS software are utilized to analyze potential cultivation areas.

4. **Main Findings**: The research reveals significant yield gaps in both irrigated and rainfed wheat production globally. The North China Plain is identified as a prime region for increased irrigated wheat production, while Europe is highlighted for expanding rainfed cultivation. Countries such as China, the United States, and Iran have significant potential for expanding irrigated wheat, whereas France, Germany, and Poland are poised to expand rainfed wheat cultivation.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: While the study does not focus specifically on legal frameworks, it emphasizes the need to adopt agronomic and technological interventions to enhance wheat production sustainably.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The study concludes that there is substantial room for increasing global wheat production, especially in untapped rainfed regions. It recommends prioritizing the reduction of production gaps in areas with high potential yield and expanding cultivation in promising regions like the North China Plain and parts of Europe.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study faces limitations due to incomplete global land use data, particularly for non-wheat crops. This hinders a comprehensive understanding of potential wheat cultivation areas. Also, the sensitivity of data regarding political climates in certain regions may affect the analysis. The GYGA protocol is highlighted as a valuable tool for future research, though more comprehensive data collection is recommended for greater insight.

Overall, the study provides a strategic approach to boosting global wheat production, advocating for targeted expansion in regions with favorable agricultural conditions.","Wheat plays a crucial role in global food security, serving as a vital food crop that feeds billions of people worldwide. Currently, Russia and Ukraine are responsible for exporting approximately 25% of the world’s wheat, making any issues in these regions a cause for concern regarding global wheat supply. The problems faced in these areas have led to a surge in wheat prices worldwide. Consequently, it becomes necessary to explore alternative regions that can compensate for the decline in wheat production and supply. This study focuses on wheat production and yield in major producing countries, utilizing the GYGA (Global Yield Gap Atlas) protocol for predictions. The findings reveal a global wheat production gap of 270,378,793 tons. Notably, the largest gap in irrigated wheat production exists in countries like China, India, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Egypt, and Azerbaijan. Additionally, the rainfed wheat production gap on a global scale amounts to 545,215,692 tons, with Russia, the USA, Kazakhstan, Australia, Ukraine, China, Turkey, Canada, India, and France having the most significant production gaps. Through boundary line analysis, specific criteria were identified for suitable areas of irrigated and rainfed wheat cultivation. For irrigated conditions, the temperature range of 3000 to 7000 GDD (Growing Degree Days) and a temperature seasonality of 3 were determined as favorable. Under rainfed conditions, the suitable areas encompass a temperature range of 2000 to 4000 GDD, an aridity index exceeding 600, and a temperature seasonality of 2. Thirteen countries possess extensive agricultural land within the climatic codes favorable for irrigated wheat cultivation. Approximately 50% of the agricultural lands within these countries, corresponding to the total arable area for irrigated wheat, fall within the climatic codes 3403, 5403, 5303, 4303, 5503, 5203, 3503, 3303, and 4103. China, the United States, Ukraine, Russia, and Iran are the top five countries with favorable lands for irrigated wheat cultivation. Similarly, fourteen countries have significant agricultural lands within the favorable climatic codes for rainfed wheat cultivation. Around 52% of the agricultural lands within these countries are within the climatic codes 3702, 2702, 2802, and 4602. France, Germany, Britain, Poland, and Denmark possess the highest potential to expand rainfed wheat cultivation areas within these favorable climate codes, with respective areas of 2.7, 2.6, 1.6, and 0.9 million hectares. According to the study, the North China Plain emerges as a primary region for increasing irrigated wheat production, both in terms of cultivated area and yield potential. For rainfed conditions, the European continent stands out as a significant region to enhance wheat production."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Afghanistan, similar to other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), faces significant challenges in maternal and newborn health due to limited resources, political instability, and gender inequality. Post-conflict Afghanistan has made efforts to improve healthcare infrastructure, but access to and quality of maternal health services remain inadequate.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research aims to assess the quality of antenatal care (ANC) services for pregnant women in Afghanistan, examining whether these services align with contemporary maternal health frameworks emphasizing a rights-based, woman-centered approach. It addresses the human rights challenge of equitable access to essential health services for women.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study analyzed data from Afghanistan's Health Survey 2018 to evaluate the coverage of eight recommended ANC services among pregnant women, comparing the findings with previous surveys and literature from other LMICs.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - Only about one-third of pregnant women received 5-8 of the recommended ANC services, with just 1.3% receiving all eight.
   - Blood pressure measurement had the highest coverage at 71.6%, showing improvement from earlier assessments.
   - Significant gaps exist in critical services like tetanus vaccination, iron and folic acid supplementation, and routine laboratory tests for anemia and pre-eclampsia.
   - Educational status of women and their husbands strongly influenced the likelihood of receiving comprehensive ANC services.
   - Cultural and socio-economic factors, including media access, also played a role in service utilization.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   While not deeply focused on legal frameworks, the study underscores the need for strong government intervention to enhance access to and quality of ANC across public and private sectors. It highlights deficiencies in the private sector due to inadequate regulation and monitoring.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that substantial improvements are needed in ANC services to meet international maternal care standards. They recommend strengthening educational programs for both women and men, enhancing health system capacity, and implementing media campaigns to raise awareness of maternal health needs. There's a call for the Afghan government and international bodies to prioritize ANC service enhancement to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   Limitations include the inability to address service prioritization or clinical decision-making and possible data constraints due to Afghanistan's complex political environment. The study also notes disparities in service coverage across socio-economic groups that warrant further research.

Overall, while strides have been made in certain aspects of maternal care, systemic barriers remain, and addressing these requires targeted interventions focusing on education, resource allocation, and regulatory oversight.","AbstractBackgroundMaternal and newborn mortality is a public health concern in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Afghanistan, where the evolving socio-political circumstances have added new complexities to healthcare service delivery. Birth outcomes for both pregnant women and their newborns are improved if women receive benefits of quality antenatal care (ANC).ObjectivesThis study aimed to assess the contents of ANC services and identify predictors of utilization of services by pregnant women during ANC visits to health facilities in Afghanistan.MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, we used data from the Afghanistan Health Survey 2018 (AHS2018). We included a total of 6,627 ever-married women, aged 14–49 years, who had given birth in the past 2 years or were pregnant at the time of survey and had consulted a health worker for ANC services in a health facility. The outcome was defined as 1–4 services and 5–8 services that a pregnant woman received during an ANC visit. The services were (i) taking a pregnant woman’s blood pressure, (ii) weighing her, (iii) testing her blood, (iv) testing her urine, (v) providing advice on nutrition, (vi) advising about complicated pregnancy, (vii) advising about the availability of health services, and (viii) giving her at least one dose of Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccine. The binary outcome (1–4 services versus 5–8 services) was used in a multivariable logistic regression model.ResultsOf all 6,627 women, 31.4% (2,083) received 5–8 services during ANC visits. Only 1.3% (86) received all 8 services, with 98.7% (6,541) receiving between 1 and 7 services, and 71.6% (4,745) women had their blood pressure measured during ANC visits. The likelihood (adOR = Adjusted Odds Ratio) of receiving 5–8 services was higher in women who could read and write (adOR = 1.33: 1.15–1.54), in women whose husbands could read and write (adOR = 1.14: 1.00-1.28), in primipara women (adOR = 1.42: 1.02–1.98), in women who knew one danger sign (adOR = 5.38: 4.50–6.45), those who knew 2 danger signs (adOR = 8.51: 7.12–10.19) and those who knew ≥ 3 danger signs (adOR = 13.19: 10.67–16.29) of complicated pregnancy, and in women who had almost daily access to TV (adOR = 1.16: 1.01–1.33). However, the likelihood of receiving 5–8 services was lower in women who used private clinics (adOR = 0.64: 0.55–0.74) and who received services from nurses (adOR = 0.27 (0.08–0.88).ConclusionOur findings have the potential to influence the design and implementation of ANC services of health interventions to improve the delivery of services to pregnant women during ANC visits."

"Hair-raising Adventures Loosely Organised: Early Years of The HALO Trust and Humanitarian Mine Action in Afghanistan, 1988–92",Angus Mitchell,https://doi.org/10.3366/shr.2023.0623,,[],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available," The HALO Trust was founded in 1988 to alleviate suffering among civilians living in hazardous areas. Today, it is the largest humanitarian de-mining charity in the world. Its earliest operations were in Afghanistan. Following the Soviet withdrawal, HALO moved into Kabul where it established a clinic for casualties of war, developed mine risk education and gradually rolled out an innovative mine clearance programme. These interventions helped to transform mine clearance from being a military legacy into a humanitarian priority. Much of the early strategic foresight for HALO extended from the military experience of the former Scottish foot soldier Colonel Colin Campbell Mitchell of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Based on semi-structured interviews with key participants and access to private papers and diaries, this article provides a narrative framework for understanding the emergence of humanitarian mine clearance or ‘mine action’, as it is now termed. Through sometimes fractious dialectical relationships with various United Nations agencies and discreet dealings with Afghanistan’s communist government and regional warlords, HALO became a vital implementing partner in the work of refugee resettlement and rehabilitation assistance. Retrieving its history contributes to a clearer identification of the intersections between military expertise, development, humanitarianism and the post-Cold War world. "
"Associations of dietary methyl donor nutrients with common psychological conditions (depression, anxiety and stress) among reproductive-aged women in Kabul, Afghanistan","Fawzia Zahidi, Hanieh Abbasi, Pamela J Surkan, Leila Azadbakht",https://doi.org/10.1186/s40795-023-00796-9,2023-11-23,['School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Human Rights']","['Nutrition', 'Mental Health', 'Gender']",,"### Summary of the Article:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The study focuses on reproductive-aged women in Kabul, Afghanistan, where, consistent with global trends, the prevalence of depression is notably higher among women. This focus is critical as global studies indicate limited research on women's mental health, particularly in regions like Afghanistan where social and political dynamics might affect women's access to health resources.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   This research aims to explore the association between methyl donor nutrient consumption and mental disorders such as stress, anxiety, and depression among reproductive-aged women. It addresses whether these nutrients could potentially mitigate mental health challenges prevalent among this demographic.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study employed a cross-sectional design, gathering data from women attending government health centers in Kabul. Dietary intake was assessed in terms of methyl donor nutrients, including B vitamins, choline, and betaine, using convenience sampling. Mental health was evaluated using the DASS 21 scale.

4. **Main Findings:**
   Women with higher methyl donor nutrient consumption showed higher intakes of various nutrients but lower intakes of cereals and vegetables. The study did not find a significant association between higher methyl donor nutrient intake and reduced mental disorders. However, some trends suggested possible protective roles for these nutrients, aligning with some studies but conflicting with others.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   The study does not specifically examine Afghanistan’s legal frameworks or policies related to human rights or women's health, focusing instead on nutritional and psychological data.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors suggest that while no significant association was found for this specific cohort, methyl donor nutrients might still play a protective role against mental health disorders. They recommend further prospective studies and clinical trials to confirm these associations.

7. **Limitations:**
   The study is limited by its cross-sectional nature, specific focus on Kabul, and use of convenience sampling, restricting its generalizability across Afghanistan. There are also broader challenges, such as variations in dietary patterns and mental health assessments across different studies, which could influence results.

Overall, while this study did not find significant evidence of a direct correlation between methyl donor nutrients and mental health improvement in women, the authors propose that further research could provide more definitive conclusions, potentially aiding in addressing human rights challenges related to women's health in Afghanistan.","Abstract
                Background
                Higher levels of methyl donor nutrients may be associated with better psychological conditions. Little is known about the association of methyl donor nutrients with psychological conditions among women especially in Asian countries such as Afghanistan.
              
                Method
                This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kabul, Afghanistan to assess the association of methyl donor nutrients with common psychological conditions (depression, anxiety and stress) among reproductive-aged women using multistage random sampling to choose one health center from each municipality out of four cardinal directions. Finally a sample of 421 reproductive-aged women with a mean BMI of 23.3 ± 5.0 kg/m2 and an age range of 15–45 years were collected. All women’s dietary intakes were obtained using a 24-recall questionnaire. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale − 21 Items (DASS-21) was used to assess psychological conditions. Chi-square tests and one-way ANOVAs were performed to assess general characteristics. Residual model test while adjusting for energy intake was used to assess nutrient intake of methyl donor nutrients and food groups. We fitted logistic regression models to assess risk for Common mental health problems (CMHPs) based on methyl donor tertiles.
              
                Result
                We observed that there is no significant association between methyl donor nutrients and psychological disorders in both crude and adjusted models (depression, OR = 0.95, CI: 0.48; 1.88; anxiety, OR = 0.88, CI: 0.43, 1.79; stress, OR = 0.73, CI: 0.38, 1.40), (p &gt; 0.05).
              
                Conclusion
                Overall, we did not find any significant association between methyl donor nutrients and depression, anxiety and stress.

Survey-based Women Empowerment Index for Afghanistan (SWEI-A): An Explanatory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses,"Omid Dadras, Mohammadsediq Hazratzai",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-023-03241-3,2023-10-25,"['Haukeland Universitetssjukehus', 'Universitetet i Bergen']",Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Economy and Infrastructure']","['Gender', 'Employment', 'Maternal Health']",,"Here's a summary of the article with the specified points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Afghanistan, one of the poorest countries globally, has faced significant and long-standing issues related to the violation of women's rights. Barriers to women's empowerment are prevalent due to cultural norms, low literacy rates, and economic constraints. The study is contextualized in a setting marked by gender inequality and male-dominated customs that limit women's socio-economic opportunities.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions/Challenges**: The research aims to address the ambiguity in conceptualizing and operationalizing women's empowerment in Afghanistan. By developing a country-specific index, it directly challenges the entrenched barriers that prevent Afghan women from achieving empowerment, which is closely linked to human rights issues such as intimate partner violence, limited access to healthcare, and restricted economic participation.

3. **Research Methods**: The study developed a 7-factor model using data from the Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey (ADHS) 2015. It employed exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to capture dimensions of women's empowerment among Afghan women aged 15–49 years. The analysis included variables almost double the amount used in a similar index for African countries.

4. **Main Findings and Human Rights Violations/Trends**: The study identified seven key domains of women's empowerment: labor force participation, attitude toward violence, decision-making, access to healthcare, literacy, age at critical life events, and property-owning. It highlights significant barriers to empowerment for Afghan women, including cultural norms that justify violence, limited decision-making power, financial and logistical barriers to healthcare, and early marriage practices.

5. **Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies**: While the study does not delve deeply into Afghanistan's legal frameworks, it underscores the need for policy interventions, especially against child marriage, to enhance women's empowerment post-marital life.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that this index is a valid tool for measuring women's empowerment in Afghanistan, providing groundwork for future studies. They recommend policy actions to improve women's access to education, economic opportunities, and healthcare, alongside community-level interventions to challenge harmful cultural norms.

7. **Limitations**: The study identifies several limitations, such as potential self-reporting biases, cultural perception variations not accounted for by DHS, and changes over time due to socio-economic development. The study's scope was limited to married women, excluding single, widowed, divorced, and separated women, which affects the generalizability of its findings. 

These findings and recommendations are critical for driving policy changes and further research aimed at empowering Afghan women in a context fraught with challenges.","AbstractThis study aimed to develop a country-specific index to measure women empowerment among married women aged 15–49 years in Afghanistan. The data from the 2015 Afghanistan demographic health survey (ADHS) was used to develop the index. The data on 26 variables across eight hypothesized domains related to women empowerment were used in EFA to probe the underlying domains in the data. CFA examined the structural validity of hypothesized factors in EFA. Four indicators were dropped during the analysis either due to the low and significantly different loading on one factor as compared to other indicators or due to overlap with other indicators loaded on different factors. The final model included 22 indicators across seven domains (labor force participation, attitude toward violence, decision-making, access to healthcare, literacy, age at critical life events, and property-owning) and had Cronbach’s alpha = 0.69; indicative of good internal reliability. The goodness-of-fit test represented an acceptable level of construct validity with the likelihood ratio, RMSEA, and SRMR values ≤ 0.05 and CFI and TLI &gt; 0.95. The developed index shares a common ground for future research concerning women empowerment in Afghanistan and can enhance the comparability of the results across future studies. In addition, having a standard index for women empowerment at the individual and country level could help assess the progress and efforts that have been made to achieve gender equality (SDG 5), and guide the direction of future policies and interventions."

Here's a summary of the article, addressing the requested points:

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   - The study is situated in Afghanistan, a country experiencing significant political upheaval following the Taliban's takeover in August 2021 after a 21-year absence. This change critically affects social and economic conditions, impacting food security and the quality of life for Afghan citizens.

2. **Research Purpose and Human Rights Challenges:**
   - The research aims to explore the association between the quality of life and food security in Afghanistan, particularly how the Taliban's resurgence influences these variables. It addresses human rights challenges related to food insecurity, a significant issue exacerbated by sociopolitical instability and structural inequalities.

3. **Research Methods:**
   - A cross-sectional study was conducted using a multi-stage stratified sampling method. Data were collected through detailed questionnaires administered during face-to-face interviews with Afghan families. The instruments included the WHOQOL-100 to measure QOL and the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) to determine food security levels. The study also employed various statistical analyses, including regression models, to determine associations between QOL domains and food insecurity.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - The study highlights a bidirectional relationship between food insecurity and quality of life. Food insecurity increased after the Taliban takeover, affecting various QOL domains negatively. These findings underscore specific human rights violations concerning access to food and the deteriorating quality of life under a restrictive regime.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   - Although specific legal frameworks are not detailed, the study implies shortcomings in addressing food insecurity and the quality of life through governmental or institutional policies, especially under Taliban governance.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - The authors conclude that food insecurity adversely affects the quality of life and vice versa. They recommend addressing structural inequalities and enhancing access to food resources through targeted policy interventions to improve QOL for Afghan households amidst political uncertainties.

7. **Study Limitations:**
   - The study's limitations include restricted data collection due to intense military conflicts and control in certain regions, potentially affecting the representativeness of the sample. The political climate under Taliban rule also raises sensitivity and accuracy challenges in gathering and interpreting data on human rights conditions, which may constrain the findings.","AbstractThe overreaching objective of the current study is to investigate the association of quality of life with Afghan households’ food insecurity. The data was collected immediately after the Taliban took control of a large part of Afghanistan. About a total of 555 households’ heads participated in a face-to-face interview, using the HFIAS and WHOQOL-100 questionnaires along with some questions related to their socioeconomic characteristics at two different times, before and after the Taliban’s takeover. The comparative analysis showed that 98% of Afghan households were food insecure after the Taliban takeover, while 70% of them faced food insecurity before the Taliban’s takeover. The quality of life in the Taliban era is worse than before the Taliban. All dimensions of quality of life have decreased, and this decrease was more pronounced for the psychological, environmental, and physical domains. It is recommended that international organizations, NGOs, and local agents focus on these dimensions of the quality of life to improve food security."

                Introduction
                This study explores the trend of urolithiasis in various countries and categorizes the countries in terms of how their urolithiasis incidence rate has changed over time.
              
                Methods
                The incidence rate of urolithiasis in 204 countries from 1990 to 2019, extracted from the Global Burden of Disease study, has been analyzed.
              
                Results
                According to the results, all regions had experienced an increasing trend in urolithiasis rate, except for Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and Southeast Asia regions (decreasing rates of -71.4, -56.2, and -9.2 per 100000, respectively). Moreover, the Caribbean region had the highest increasing trend of urolithiasis rates, and Central Asia was in the next rank (increasing rate of 48.3 and 34.3 per 100,000, respectively, p-value &lt; .05). Also, African regions revealed significant increasing trends over time (p-value &lt; 0.05). The outstanding findings in cluster analysis showed that Afghanistan, Andorra, and Comoros had the most decreasing trend in urolithiasis rates over time (decreasing rate of -128.2 per 100000, p-value &lt; .001). Cuba, Cyprus, Czechia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Denmark, and Djibouti were in the next rank in terms of decreasing rate (decreasing rate of -92.3 per 100000, p-value &lt; .001). In addition, urolithiasis rates in Congo, Eswatini, Gabon, and Grenada have the most increasing trend (increasing rate of 116.1 per 100000, p-value &lt; .001).
              
                Conclusion
                The trend of urolithiasis rates was significantly increased in most countries, and Congo, Eswatini, Gabon, and Grenada had the highest trend among others.

**1. Historical, Political, or Social Context:**

The study is situated within the broader context of the refugee crisis in Europe, particularly in Germany, and focuses on the integration and well-being of adolescent refugees. Given the influx of refugees due to conflicts in the Middle East, Germany has been a prominent host nation, raising social and political questions about the integration of refugees. The study examines how adolescent refugees adapt to life in Germany, particularly regarding their gender role attitudes and affective well-being.

**2. Purpose of the Research:**

The research aims to explore the cross-cultural comparison of gender role attitudes and affective well-being between adolescent refugees and German adolescents. It addresses the human rights challenges related to the integration and mental health of refugee populations, highlighting the need to support their development and ensure equitable rights and treatment.

**3. Research Methods:**

The study employs a cross-sectional design with a focus on measurement invariance. Participants were adolescent refugees in Germany, collected in two waves (first in 2019 and second in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic), and German adolescents sampled from schools. Data collection involved self-reported questionnaires, measuring gender role attitudes and affective well-being in languages including German, Arabic, and Persian. Strict criteria were applied to handle missing data, leading to a final sample of 113 refugee and 113 German adolescents for analysis.

**4. Main Findings:**

- The study found acceptable levels of reliability in measures of gender role attitudes across both samples, though slightly higher in the German sample.
- Measurement invariance tests showed that structural relationships could be compared between refugee and German adolescents, suggesting that the constructs had a similar meaning in both groups.
- Differences emerged in gender role attitudes and affective well-being, reflecting varying cultural perspectives and challenges faced by refugees.

**5. Examination of Legal Frameworks:**

While the study does not explicitly examine legal frameworks, it implicitly addresses integration policies and the importance of culturally sensitive measures to support refugee adolescents' mental health and adaptation.

**6. Conclusions and Recommendations:**

The authors conclude that understanding and supporting the affective well-being and gender role attitudes of refugee adolescents is crucial for their successful integration. They recommend implementing culturally competent mental health services and educational programs that address the unique needs of refugee populations, facilitating their adaptation and acceptance within host countries.

**7. Limitations:**

The study acknowledges several limitations, including the high exclusion rate due to strict missing data criteria, which may have impacted the sample's representativeness. The language barrier and sociopolitical climate may also affect the sensitivity and reporting of refugees' experiences. Additionally, the cross-sectional design limits the ability to establish causality between variables. The COVID-19 pandemic posed further challenges, as it altered traditional data collection methods, potentially influencing responses.","Abstract
                Background
                Assumed differences in gender role attitudes (GRAs) of German adolescents and refugee adolescents from the Middle East are often discussed, but rarely investigated. Presumed differences in GRAs across cultures and genders are assumed to be involved in emerging gender differences in well-being and mental health symptoms. Overall, appropriate measurements for investigating GRAs of adolescents with different cultural backgrounds are scarce.

                Hence, the present study exemplarily investigates (1) the measurement invariance (MI) of a German translation of the Social Role Questionnaire (SRQ) for German (n = 114) and German-speaking Middle Eastern refugee adolescents from Syria, Afghanistan, or Iraq (n = 115), using a Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause (MIMIC) model to account for age and gender. Moreover, (2) differences between GRAs of both groups, (3) relationships of GRAs with different facets of affective well-being, as well as (4) differences in these relationships between German and refugee adolescents are examined by extending the MIMIC-model to a full structural equation model (SEM).
              
                Results
                Results indicate (1) that scalar MI for the SRQ can be assumed. Furthermore, (2) German adolescents show less traditional gender-linked GRAs than refugee adolescents, but no further differences in GRAs. Furthermore, no differences between the relationships of GRAs with well-being and mental health symptoms were found between the groups (4). Also, (3) GRAs showed no relation with any of the outcomes, but gender and age predicted mental health symptoms.
              
                Conclusion
                The findings show that the SRQ is a useful measurement for investigating the GRAs of adolescents living in Germany and could be used in further cross-cultural research.

Predicting maternal healthcare seeking behaviour in Afghanistan: exploring sociodemographic factors and women’s knowledge of severity of illness,"Essa Tawfiq, Mohammad Daud Azimi, Aeraj Feroz, Ahmad Shakir Hadad, Mohammad Samim Soroush, Massoma Jafari, Marzia Salam Yaftali, Sayed Ataullah Saeedzai",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-023-05750-y,2023-8-2,['The Kirby Institute'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Human Rights']","['Maternal Health', 'Gender']",,"**1. Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
The study is situated within the context of maternal healthcare utilization in Afghanistan, a country with one of the lowest rates of antenatal care (ANC) visits, postnatal care (PNC) visits, and institutional deliveries compared to other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The situation is exacerbated by political instability, notably worsened after the Taliban took control in August 2021, affecting healthcare delivery and accessibility, especially concerning women's rights and roles.

**2. Purpose of Research & Human Rights Challenges:**
The research aims to investigate factors influencing healthcare-seeking behaviors related to maternal health services among women in Afghanistan. It addresses human rights challenges by highlighting disparities in women’s access to essential health services and the influence of social determinants such as education, socioeconomic status, and family decision-making dynamics on these rights.

**3. Research Methods:**
The study analyzed data from a nationally representative survey of 9,190 ever-married women in Afghanistan. Researchers explored sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge levels of illness severity, and healthcare-seeking behaviors concerning ANC, PNC visits, and institutional deliveries.

**4. Main Findings:**
- Only 2% of women attended at least 4 PNC visits, 22% for ANC, and 56% had institutional deliveries.
- Sociodemographic factors such as education, socioeconomic status, access to media, and family decisions were significant predictors of healthcare seeking.
- Prioritizing the decisions of husbands and in-laws over women’s autonomy often led to higher institutional delivery rates.
- Significant barriers like distance, cost, and security concerns affected healthcare access.

**5. Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
While specific legal frameworks are not discussed, the study highlights systemic issues that undermine women's rights to healthcare, exacerbated by restrictive policies under the Taliban regime that limit women’s freedom and role in society, influencing the broader healthcare landscape.

**6. Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
The study concludes that education and media access are crucial in improving maternal health service utilization. It recommends enhancing community engagement, improving the quality of health facilities, and promoting women's knowledge to increase healthcare access and use. It underscores the need for concerted efforts to integrate COVID-19 management into existing health services without diverting resources from maternal healthcare.

**7. Limitations of the Study:**
- Reliance on secondary data limits findings to pre-August 2021 scenarios.
- Absence of a theoretical cognitive model such as the Health Belief Model made it tough to capture all facets of healthcare-seeking behaviors.
- Potential social desirability bias in self-reported data.
- Political changes post-2021 and the Taliban's restrictions on media and women impact current applicability.
- COVID-19's impact on healthcare systems was not addressed, posing further challenges in contexts post the data collection period.

In summary, the research marks critical insights into Afghanistan's healthcare challenges, recommending robust educational and policy-oriented interventions with awareness of sociopolitical dynamics to address ongoing human rights issues concerning maternal health.","AbstractBackgroundLittle is known whether women’s knowledge of perceived severity of illness and sociodemographic characteristics of women influence healthcare seeking behavior for maternal health services in Afghanistan. The aim of this study was to address this knowledge gap.MethodsData were used from the Afghanistan Health Survey 2018. Women’s knowledge in terms of danger signs or symptoms during pregnancy was assessed. The signs or symptoms were bleeding, swelling of the body, headache, fever, or any other danger sign or symptom (e.g., high blood pressure). A categorical variable of knowledge score was created. The outcome variables were defined as ≥ 4 ANC vs. 0–3 ANC; ≥ 4 PNC vs. 0–3 PNC visits; institutional vs. non-institutional deliveries. A multivariable generalized linear model (GLM) was used.ResultsData were used from 9,190 ever-married women, aged 13–49 years, who gave birth in the past two years. It was found that 56%, 22% and 2% of women sought healthcare for institutional delivery, ≥ 4 ANC, ≥ 4 PNC visits, respectively, and that women’s knowledge is a strong predictor of healthcare seeking [odds ratio (OR)1.77(1.54–2.05), 2.28(1.99–2.61), and 2.78 (2.34–3.32) on knowledge of 1, 2, and 3–5 signs or symptoms, respectively, in women with ≥ 4 ANC visits when compared with women who knew none of the signs or symptoms. In women with ≥ 4 PNC visits, it was 1.80(1.12–2.90), 2.22(1.42–3.48), and 3.33(2.00–5.54), respectively. In women with institutional deliveries, it was 1.49(1.32–1.68), 2.02(1.78–2.28), and 2.34(1.95–2.79), respectively. Other strong predictors were women’s education level, multiparity, residential areas (urban vs. rural), socioeconomic status, access to mass media (radio, TV, the internet), access of women to health workers for birth, and decision-making for women where to deliver. However, age of women was not a strong predictor.ConclusionOur findings suggest that pregnant women’s healthcare seeking behaviour is influenced by women’s knowledge of danger signs and symptoms during pregnancy, women’s education, socioeconomic status, access to media, husband’s, in-laws’ and relatives’ decisions, residential area, multiparity, and access to health workers. The findings have implications for promoting safe motherhood and childbirth practices through improving women’s knowledge, education, and social status."
Prevalence and predictors of depression among women in Afghanistan: a cross-sectional study,"Ahmad Neyazi, Ahmad Shoaib Haidarzada, Vanya Rangelova, Adiba Erfan, Bahara Bashiri, Mehrab Neyazi, Naweed Faizi, Hande Konşuk-Ünlü, Mark D. Griffiths",https://doi.org/10.1007/s44202-023-00068-4,2023-3-6,['Afghanistan Center for Epidemiological Studies'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Human Rights']","['Gender', 'Gender Apartheid', 'Maternal Health', 'Disease Prevention']",,"The article explores the high prevalence of depression among women in Afghanistan, a country deeply impacted by over four decades of conflict that has dismantled its social, economic, and cultural structures. This study examines the mental health challenges Afghan women face, specifically focusing on the widespread issue of depression.

### Context
Afghanistan's prolonged war has severely impacted its infrastructure, particularly affecting women who are subject to patriarchal norms and often lack education and financial independence. Violence against women and limited psychiatric services exacerbate their mental health issues.

### Research Purpose
The study seeks to understand the prevalence and factors of depression among Afghan women and addresses significant human rights issues related to mental health care accessibility, and societal roles.

### Methods
The study employs a cross-sectional design, collecting data on depression symptoms among women in selected urban areas. It uses logistic regression to analyze associations between depressive symptoms and various sociodemographic factors.

### Main Findings
- **High Prevalence:** The study finds a staggering 79.1% of women exhibit depressive symptoms, particularly those over 30, living in rural areas, with low income or education levels. Higher depression rates were noted among married and widowed women versus single ones.
- **Associated Factors:** Age, marital status, educational status, and existing illnesses significantly contribute to the likelihood of depression.

### Legal Framework and Policies
Although not explicitly detailed in terms of legal frameworks, the study suggests that ongoing conflict and the resultant lack of services significantly impact mental health, with an implicit critique of current laws under Taliban rule affecting women's rights and mental health services.

### Conclusions and Recommendations
The authors conclude that there is an urgent need for integrating mental health services for women in Afghanistan. They recommend regular depression screenings, education on self-diagnosis, and enhanced psychiatric care, particularly for elderly, rural, and ill women. They call for more inclusive future research considering rural populations and current laws affecting women's mental health under the Taliban.

### Limitations
The study is limited by its small, urban-focused sample, which may not represent rural women's experiences. Its cross-sectional nature precludes causal conclusions, and these limitations are compounded by challenges in data collection due to the country's political climate and ongoing conflict.","AbstractDepression is a very common mental health illness characterized by a cluster of signs and symptoms ranging from mood disturbances and sleep or appetite disorders to physical manifestations of the body. The purpose of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of depression and its related factors among Afghan women. A cross-sectional study was conducted among women between July 14, 2021, to August 15, 2021, in Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif and Samangan provinces (Afghanistan). A total of 664 Afghan women participated in the study (mean age = 28.85 years; SD ± 11.57). In order to assess depression among participants, the 19-item validated Dari version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression Scale was used. Approximately four-fifths of the sample had depression symptoms (79.1%). Participants with depression symptoms were significantly more likely to (i) be aged over 30 years, (ii) live in rural areas, (iii) have a low-income level, (iv) not have an occupation, (v) have any disease/illness, and (vi) have experienced an event that had mentally affected them in the past month. Considering the high prevalence of depression symptoms among Afghan women, there is a need to integrate mental health services for women in Afghanistan. The use of interventions including regular screening for depression symptoms, and educating women and girls concerning the symptoms of depression for early self-diagnosis are essential."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**

   The article focuses on health system evaluations in conflict-affected and post-conflict countries. These settings include regions such as Afghanistan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Palestine, and several others where political instability and armed conflict have significantly impacted public health systems. The research looks into data collected during and after conflicts, aiming to provide insights into the challenges these regions face.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Questions:**

   The research aims to synthesize findings from various studies on health systems in conflict settings. It addresses human rights issues related to access to healthcare, health system performance, and the impacts of conflict on public health. The research seeks to illuminate challenges in health service delivery and the role of international versus local leadership in health system evaluations.

3. **Research Methods:**

   The article analyzes 58 sources, predominantly qualitative. These include semi-structured and in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, cross-sectional surveys, and some mixed-method approaches. The studies are largely led by international institutions, with a minority led by local entities.

4. **Main Findings:**

   - There is a lack of comprehensive evaluations across all health system components.
   - Limited local leadership and participation in research, with most studies led by foreign institutions.
   - Absence of local voices, especially in remote studies, leading to a lack of diverse perspectives.
   - Data availability issues, with gaps and discrepancies reported in many studies.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**

   The article does not focus extensively on national legal frameworks or policies related to human rights directly but highlights the governance, resilience, and financing aspects of health systems, often underpinned by international frameworks.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**

   The authors conclude that more locally-led research is needed to ensure that evaluations are relevant and reflective of the actual health system challenges communities face. They recommend enhancing theory-informed research, diversifying study designs, improving local engagement, and addressing biases in studies to provide more holistic health evaluations.

7. **Limitations:**

   The key limitations include limited local participation and leadership in research, biases from international perspectives, restricted data access, and methodological preferences that may not fully capture the complexities of the settings studied. Political climates and insecurity also impede data collection and analysis in conflict zones.

Overall, the article underscores the importance of integrating local voices and leadership in evaluating health systems in conflict-affected regions, highlighting significant gaps and biases in existing research that could impact broader generalizations and policy recommendations.","Abstract
                Introduction
                Strengthening health systems in conflict-affected settings has become increasingly professionalised. However, evaluation remains challenging and often insufficiently documented in the literature. Many, particularly small-scale health system evaluations, are conducted by government bodies or non-governmental organisations (NGO) with limited capacity to publish their experiences. It is essential to identify the existing literature and main findings as a baseline for future efforts to evaluate the capacity and resilience of conflict-affected health systems. We thus aimed to synthesise the scope of methodological approaches and methods used in the peer-reviewed literature on health system evaluation in conflict-affected settings.
              
                Methods
                We conducted a scoping review using Arksey and O’Malley’s method and synthesised findings using the WHO health system ‘building blocks’ framework.
              
                Results
                We included 58 eligible sources of 2,355 screened, which included examination of health systems or components in 26 conflict-affected countries, primarily South Sudan and Afghanistan (7 sources each), Democratic Republic of the Congo (6), and Palestine (5). Most sources (86%) were led by foreign academic institutes and international donors and focused on health services delivery (78%), with qualitative designs predominating (53%). Theoretical or conceptual grounding was extremely limited and study designs were not generally complex, as many sources (43%) were NGO project evaluations for international donors and relied on simple and lower-cost methods. Sources were also limited in terms of geography (e.g., limited coverage of the Americas region), by component (e.g., preferences for specific components such as service delivery), gendered (e.g., limited participation of women), and colonised (e.g., limited authorship and research leadership from affected countries).
              
                Conclusion
                The evaluation literature in conflict-affected settings remains limited in scope and content, favouring simplified study designs and methods, and including those components and projects implemented or funded internationally. Many identified challenges and limitations (e.g., limited innovation/contextualisation, poor engagement with local actors, gender and language biases) could be mitigated with more rigorous and systematic evaluation approaches.

Estimation of global rating changes in quality of life and marital satisfaction among reproductive age women in Iran and Afghanistan before and after COVID-19 pandemic,"Masomeh Khalili, Shahideh Jahanian Sadatmahalleh, Malihe Nasiri, Ali Montazeri",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-023-02467-0,2023-6-16,['Tarbiat Modares University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Culture, Society, and Heritage']","['COVID-19', 'Culture', 'Gender']",,"**Summary of the Article:**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The study provides insight into the impact of COVID-19 on the quality of life and marital satisfaction of women in Iran and Afghanistan. Historically and politically, these neighboring countries have different socio-cultural dynamics, which have influenced the perceptions and experiences of women in these societies, especially during the pandemic.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research aims to explore the differences in quality of life and marital satisfaction between Iranian and Afghan women during the COVID-19 pandemic. It addresses the human rights challenge of understanding how social restrictions and pandemic-related changes impact women's well-being in these two distinct contexts.

3. **Research Methods:**
   A comparative study was conducted using survey data from Iranian and Afghan women. The study focused on mental and physical component summary scores and assessed factors like marital satisfaction and quality of life changes related to the pandemic.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - No significant difference in quality of life scores was found between Iranian and Afghan women, though Iranian women reported a decline in quality of life more frequently.
   - Iranian women generally had higher marital satisfaction compared to Afghan women, with Afghan women being 3.25 times more likely to report lower satisfaction.
   - Cultural, social, and economic factors, as well as differing pandemic measures, likely contributed to these disparities.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   The study did not explicitly analyze the legal frameworks or human rights policies in Iran and Afghanistan, but it highlighted how social and policy differences in handling COVID-19 restrictions potentially influenced personal and social well-being.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors noted that social restrictions and cultural factors contributed to the differences observed. They recommended future qualitative studies to better understand the nuanced impact of COVID-19 on women's quality of life and marital satisfaction in these countries.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   - The study's descriptive nature and sampling method limit generalizability.
   - The inability to include quarantined women could skew results.
   - The use of global ratings may not fully capture changes in quality of life and marital satisfaction, suggesting the need for more nuanced qualitative research.

Overall, the study underscores the importance of considering cultural and policy contexts in addressing human rights and well-being issues during global crises like the pandemic.","AbstractBackgroundQuality of life and marital satisfaction are important components of reproductive-age women’s health. This study aimed to compare the quality of life and marital satisfaction in women of reproductive age in Iran and Afghanistan before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study on a sample of Iranian and Afghan women of reproductive age. To collect the data, the 12-item short-form health survey (SF-12) and the Enrich marital satisfaction scale were used to assess the quality of life and marital satisfaction, respectively. In addition, the Global Rating of Change (GRC) was used in order to evaluate the quality of life and marital satisfaction compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were evaluated descriptively through statistics including sing t-test, and chi-square, Logistic regression was performed to assess the relationship between outcome variables and independent variables.ResultsIn all 599 reproductive-age women (300 Iranian, and 299 Afghan) were studied. After adjusting for demographic variables, no significant difference was observed between the two groups for the physical component (P = 0.05) and mental component summary scores of quality of life (P = 0.166) as measured by the SF-12. The majority of Iranian women reported that their quality of life was worsened compared to before the pandemic (57.2%), while in the Afghan group, a higher percentage declared that it was unchanged (58.9%). The mental component of quality of life had no significant relationship with any of the independent variables including nationality. In contrast, the physical component quality of life had a significant relationship with nationality (P = 0.01). Iranian women had more marital satisfaction than Afghan women (P&lt;0.001) and marital satisfaction had a significant relationship with nationality (P&lt;0.001). Most women in both groups (70% of Iranian and 60% of Afghan women) declared that their marital satisfaction unchanged compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic.ConclusionThe results showed that the quality of life of Iranian and Afghan women of reproductive age was almost the same before and after the pandemic. However, Iranians scored lower on the mental component summary and Afghans reported lower scores on the physical component summary. Marital satisfaction of Afghan women was much lower than that of Iranian women. The findings suggest the need for serious attention by health care authorities. Providing a supportive environment might be considered a primary step towards a better quality of life for these populations."

    - The authors stress the urgent need to address financial constraints, Taliban restrictions, and a lack of resources, underscoring the risk of further deteriorating health outcomes for Afghan women and children.
    - There is a critical need for international financial support and policies to ensure healthcare accessibility.
  
7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study is constrained by the political climate in Afghanistan, which affects data availability and the sensitivity of the topic. There is also a lack of functional surveillance systems to accurately measure maternal and child mortality rates, impacting data reliability and comprehensiveness.","Abstract
                Background
                The Taliban takeover in August 2021 brought global economic sanctions, economic collapse, and draconian restrictions on women’s freedom of movement, work, political participation, and education. This study examined Afghan health workers’ experiences and perceptions of availability and quality of maternal and child health care since then.
              
                Methods
                We conducted a survey, using a convenience sample, of health workers from urban, semi-rural, and rural public and private clinics and hospitals across the 34 provinces, covering changes in working conditions, safety, health care access and quality, maternal and infant mortality as well as perceptions about the future of maternal and child health and health care. Interviews were conducted with a subsample of health workers to further explore their perceptions of changes in working conditions, quality of care, and health outcomes since the Taliban takeover.
              
                Results
                131 Afghan practicing health care workers completed the survey. The majority were women (80%) working in facilities located in urban areas. Most female health workers (73.3%) reported that they have not always been safe when going to and from work; 81% because of harassment by the Taliban when they did not have male accompaniment. Almost half of the respondents (42.9%) reported a decrease in availability of maternal and child care and 43.8% stated that conditions for providing care were “worse” or “much worse” than before. Almost one-third (30.2%) indicated that changed working conditions negatively impacted their ability to provide quality care, and 26.2% reported an increase in obstetric and newborn complications. Health workers also reported (38.1% )an increase in sick child needs and an increase in child malnutrition (57.1%0. 57.1% reported decreases in work attendance and 78.6% a decrease in morale and motivation. Qualitative interviews (n = 10) of a subsample of survey participants expanded on these findings.
              
                Conclusion
                The combination of economic collapse, lack of sustained donor support for health care and Taliban interference with human rights has severely compromised access and quality of maternal and child health care. Strong and concerted international pressure on the Taliban to respect women and children rights to essential health service is critical for the future of the Afghan population.

The burden of musculoskeletal disorders in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region: a longitudinal analysis from the global burden of disease dataset 1990—2019,"Yazan A. Al-Ajlouni, Omar Al Ta’ani, Rand Mushasha, Justin Lin Lee, Jaishree Capoor, Mitul R. Kapadia, Ruth Alejandro",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-023-06556-x,2023-5-31,['New York Medical College'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Economy and Infrastructure']","['Disease Prevention', 'Risk Factors']",,"**Overview of Historical, Political, or Social Context:**

This study focuses on musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, an area often underrepresented in health research. The MENA region's diverse socio-political landscape and often limited healthcare infrastructure can impact the general well-being of its populations.

**Purpose of Research and Human Rights Challenges:**

The research aims to evaluate the burden of MSK disorders in MENA from 1990 to 2019 and identify relevant risk factors. It highlights health policy needs to tackle these disorders, considering their significant impact on disability and life quality. Although MSK disorders are not typically associated with high mortality, they significantly impair the quality of life, which raises questions about healthcare priorities in the region.

**Research Methods:**

The study utilizes data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 dataset, which incorporates comprehensive analyses updated with new disease classifications and refined uncertainty estimates. It is the first to provide national-level comparisons of MSK disorder burdens among different MENA countries.

**Main Findings:**

- Iran, Turkey, and Jordan exhibit the highest burden of MSK disorders in the region.
- Occupational risk factors were historically the most significant contributors but have decreased over time due to shifts in the nature of work influenced by technological advancements.
- High body mass index (BMI) has increasingly contributed to MSK disorders, emphasizing the need for interventions targeting diet, alcohol, and physical inactivity.
- Smoking is a significant risk factor, especially among males, while high BMI is more significant among females.

**Examination of Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies:**

The study notes that health systems in the MENA region often prioritize curative over preventative care and tend to undervalue conditions like MSK disorders that are not directly linked to mortality. There's a call for more integrative healthcare that includes promotion, prevention, and rehabilitation to address the rising burden of MSK disorders.

**Conclusions and Recommendations:**

Authors recommend tailored interventions and public health policies that consider gender and age group differences to manage MSK disorders effectively. They emphasize interdisciplinary and cross-sector approaches to screening and treatment in the region.

**Limitations of the Study:**

The study relies on secondary data, which can be inconsistent due to variable data collection systems across MENA countries. This might result in biases or errors in estimating the true burden. The lack of differentiation between acute and chronic conditions and the potential confounding factors influencing DALYs were also acknowledged as limitations. Political instability and immigration patterns could further affect data accuracy.

**Future Research Directions:**

Future studies should use diverse datasets and longitudinal designs to verify current findings and potentially establish causation. Exploring the impact of socioeconomic and genetic factors on MSK disorders is also suggested.","AbstractBackgroundMusculoskeletal (MSK) disorders are one of the main causes of disability among adults globally. The burden of MSK disorders varies greatly between different regions and is the highest in low- and middle income- countries. This study sought to investigate trends in the burden of MSK disorders across the MENA region, utilizing the GBD 2019 dataset.MethodsThis ecological study utilized data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) to report on the burden of musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders in The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region between 1990 and 2019. Our analysis involved descriptive statistics and sociodemographic trends and did not employ any specific statistical analyses. Using age-standardized rates of prevalence and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), we reported trends in the burden of MSK disorders, as well as national variation between different countries. Furthermore, we analyzed trends in risk factors contributing to MSK disorders by age and gender.ResultsThe longitudinal analysis from 1990 to 2019 showed an increase in the age-standardized rate for prevalence and DALYs of MSK disorders by 5% and 4.80%, respectively. Low back pain continued to be the most prevalent MSK condition, while RA and other MSK disorders had the largest percentage increase for DALYs between 1990 and 2019. The study found that Afghanistan had the lowest age standardized DALYs rate attributed to MSK disorders, while Iran, Turkey, and Jordan had the highest. Further, Syria showed the most dramatic decrease while Saudi Arabia had the most notable increase in age standardized DALY rates from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, occupational risks, high body mass index, and tobacco smoking were the main risk factors for MSK disorders, with occupational risks being the largest contributor, and between 1990 and 2019, there was a decrease in the contribution of occupational risks but an increase in the contribution of high body mass index as a risk factor.ConclusionThis study highlights the significant burden of MSK disorders in the MENA region, with various risk factors contributing to its increasing prevalence in recent decades. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying factors and potential interventions that could improve health outcomes. Addressing MSK disorders should be a public health priority in the region, and efforts should be made to develop effective strategies to prevent and manage this debilitating condition."
The most at-risk regions in the world for high-impact heatwaves,"Vikki Thompson, Dann Mitchell, Gabriele C. Hegerl, Matthew Collins, Nicholas J. Leach, Julia M. Slingo",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37554-1,2023-4-25,['University of Bristol'],Article,1,Yes,"['Environment', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Climate', 'Disaster Risk Reduction']",,"The article discusses the record-breaking heatwave that occurred in June 2021 in western North America, particularly focusing on Lytton, British Columbia, where temperatures reached 49.6 °C. This event was linked to an unusual atmospheric pattern and was considered nearly impossible without the influence of climate change.

**1. Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
The heatwave forms part of a larger context of extreme weather events that have been increasingly linked to climate change. Such events raise concerns about societal and ecosystem vulnerabilities and the adequacy of existing infrastructures and policies to handle extreme climate phenomena.

**2. Purpose of the Research:**
The research aimed to assess the likelihood and consequences of unprecedented heat events globally. It specifically explored the challenges of statistically improbable weather events, identifying regions most susceptible to such extremes and evaluating potential implications for human vulnerabilities and development.

**3. Research Methods:**
The study employed a generalised extreme value (GEV) statistical method using reanalysis data from ERA5 to estimate return periods of extreme temperature events globally. It compared extremes in two datasets to ascertain consistency and employed a global climate model ensemble (CMIP6) to analyze extreme events' statistical properties.

**4. Main Findings:**
The 2021 heatwave was found to be beyond any historically plausible maximum when compared to the period from 1959 to 2021. The study revealed that 31% of land regions have experienced record events that deviate significantly from the statistical norm. It identified regions like Afghanistan and Central America as particularly vulnerable due to their developmental status and population dynamics.

**5. Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
While the study does not investigate legal frameworks explicitly, it raises questions about the preparedness of legal and infrastructural systems in various countries to manage unprecedented climatic extremes, suggesting a need for robust heat adaptation plans.

**6. Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
The authors conclude that many regions might face record-level heat events not captured by historical data and that even developed regions are not immune. They recommend enhancing global monitoring systems and creating stringent adaptation strategies, particularly in vulnerable regions, to mitigate heatwave impacts.

**7. Limitations of the Study:**
The study acknowledges limitations due to the inherent uncertainties of statistical modeling and potential selection bias in excluding record years. It also highlights the possible non-linear effects of climate change and constraints relating to observational data length and quality in less explored regions.","AbstractHeatwaves are becoming more frequent under climate change and can lead to thousands of excess deaths. Adaptation to extreme weather events often occurs in response to an event, with communities learning fast following unexpectedly impactful events. Using extreme value statistics, here we show where regional temperature records are statistically likely to be exceeded, and therefore communities might be more at-risk. In 31% of regions examined, the observed daily maximum temperature record is exceptional. Climate models suggest that similar behaviour can occur in any region. In some regions, such as Afghanistan and parts of Central America, this is a particular problem - not only have they the potential for far more extreme heatwaves than experienced, but their population is growing and increasingly exposed because of limited healthcare and energy resources. We urge policy makers in vulnerable regions to consider if heat action plans are sufficient for what might come."
Changes in life satisfaction among unaccompanied asylum-seeking and refugee minors who participated in teaching recovery techniques (TRT),"Anne Kristine Solhaug, Espen Røysamb, Brit Oppedal",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-023-00595-x,2023-4-18,['Folkehelseinstituttet'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Civil Liberties', 'Freedom of Speech', 'Migration', 'Disaster Risk Reduction']",,"**Summary:**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The study focuses on unaccompanied refugee minors (URMs) in Norway, who often experience high levels of PTSD due to traumatic pasts and unstable asylum statuses. This demographic faces unique challenges during the asylum process, impacting their mental health and life satisfaction.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research investigates whether participation in Trauma Recovery Therapy (TRT), a low-threshold, group-based intervention, leads to increased life satisfaction among URMs. It addresses the challenge of improving mental health outcomes and life satisfaction in this vulnerable group.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study involves a nationwide sample of URMs exhibiting PTSD symptoms. It assesses changes in life satisfaction from pre-to post-intervention and at follow-up periods, without a control group due to practical constraints.

4. **Main Findings:**
   Participants showed a significant increase in life satisfaction from pre- to post-intervention, an effect that persisted at follow-up. The improvement is linked to TRT participation rather than other factors. Youth granted residence showed better life satisfaction compared to those still awaiting asylum decisions.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   The study highlights the impact of asylum status on mental health, suggesting the need to differentiate intervention approaches based on whether URMs have been granted residence.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   TRT appears beneficial in increasing life satisfaction and can be effectively incorporated into a stepped care model for refugees. Recommendations include organizing booster sessions post-TRT, refining the intervention to address asylum-related stressors, and emphasizing the complexity of URMs' needs requiring coordinated care.

7. **Limitations:**
   The study's lack of a control group weakens causal conclusions. Cultural and linguistic diversity across the sample, and the predominance of Afghan youth, may limit generalizability. Variability in intervention delivery and uncertain facilitator influence remain unexamined, highlighting future research needs for robust design and comprehensive compliance metrics.","Abstract
                Background
                Unaccompanied asylum-seeking and refugee minors report low life satisfaction and high levels of mental health problems, nevertheless they often do not seek or receive help for their problems. Teaching Recovery Techniques (TRT) is a low-threshold, five sessions intervention developed to reduce distressing war- and disaster-related trauma reactions among children and youth. In this study, we investigate if TRT can contribute to increased life satisfaction among unaccompanied asylum-seeking and refugee minors.
              
                Methods
                Asylum-seeking and resettled unaccompanied minors participated in TRT carried out in 15 locations throughout Norway, n = 147, mean age = 16.61 (SD = 1.80), 88% boys, and 67% from Afghanistan. Life satisfaction was measured by the Cantril Ladder before the intervention, and two- and eight weeks post-intervention. We also included indices of intervention compliance and contextual variables, such as asylum status. We applied a pre- and post-intervention design with linear mixed model analyses to investigate change in life satisfaction.
              
                Results
                Life satisfaction significantly increased from pre- to post- intervention, but not for youth whose asylum application had been rejected or who were still awaiting a decision. Indices of intervention compliance were associated with an increase in life satisfaction.
              
                Conclusions
                TRT is a potential useful intervention to enhance life satisfaction among unaccompanied asylum-seeking and refugee minors and can be a measure to support positive development among youth at risk for mental health problems. However, TRT initiatives should consider the participant’s stage of asylum process, because harsh immigration policies may overburden the coping capacity. Without further adaptation, TRT seems most useful for youth granted residence. The manual has been revised to include asylum-related stressors.

Emergency care in post-conflict settings: a systematic literature review,"Kalin Werner, Mohini Kak, Christopher H. Herbst, Tracy Kuo Lin",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12873-023-00775-0,2023-4-1,"['University of California, San Francisco', 'University of Cape Town']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Economy and Infrastructure']","['Emergency Care Systems', 'Infrastructure Challenges']",,"**Summary:**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The study focuses on Emergency Care Systems (ECS) in fragile and conflict-affected settings, emphasizing the unique challenges these regions face. Post-conflict settings often deal with lingering infrastructural destruction, social distrust among communities, scarcity of resources, and lack of formal emergency care training. These obstacles stem from the lasting impacts of conflict, where health systems are disrupted, and trust is diminished.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Questions:**
   The research aims to identify barriers to delivering emergency care in post-conflict environments and assess gaps in existing systems. Human rights issues addressed include the right to health care and equitable access to emergency services, especially in contexts where infrastructure and social conditions hinder service delivery.

3. **Research Methods Used:**
   The study conducted a systematic literature review, examining descriptive studies that explore challenges and needs within emergency care frameworks in post-conflict settings. The review focused on identifying common barriers and potential solutions to improve ECS in these fragile contexts.

4. **Main Findings:**
   Key challenges include poor infrastructure, social distrust, scarce formal emergency care training, and lack of resources. For example, in Colombia, there is a discrepancy between those needing and seeking emergency care services. In Somaliland, inadequate access to timely care was highlighted. In Afghanistan, facilities were found to lack essential supplies and equipment. Cross-cultural issues, such as ethnic distrust in Kosovo and unequal treatment in health services, were also evident.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   The study notes the absence of structured ECS policies in many post-conflict areas. Efforts to harmonize emergency care training through educational interventions were observed, particularly in Liberia and Rwanda, aiming to establish consistent emergency care curricula and improve service delivery frameworks.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors recommend enhancing ECS by improving infrastructure, increasing formal training programs, and augmenting resources. They call for stronger advocacy for emergency care funding and awareness in fragile settings. Community-based care efforts such as first-aid training can reduce morbidity in these environments. Future research should focus on quantitatively assessing effective interventions in post-conflict settings.

7. **Limitations:**
   Significant limitations include defining what constitutes a post-conflict setting and the scope of ECS interventions. The study's descriptive nature means many findings cannot be generalized due to heterogeneous post-conflict environments. Data scarcity in certain regions and the sensitivity of political climates further constrain the study, as post-conflict contexts often fluctuate between states of conflict and peace.","Abstract
                Background
                Emergency care systems (ECS) organize and provide access to life-saving care both during transport and at health facilities. Not enough is known about ECS in uncertain contexts such as post-conflict settings. This review aims to systematically identify and summarize the published evidence on the delivery of emergency care in post-conflict settings and to guide health sector planning.
              
                Methods
                We searched five databases (PubMed MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane) in September 2021 to identify relevant articles on ECS in post-conflict settings. Included studies (1) described a context that is post-conflict, conflict-affected, or was impacted by war or crisis; (2) examined the delivery of an emergency care system function; (3) were available in English, Spanish, or French; and (4) were published between 1 and 2000 and 9 September 2021. Data were extracted and mapped using the essential system functions identified in the World Health Organization (WHO) ECS Framework to capture findings on essential emergency care functions at the scene of injury or illness, during transport, and through to the emergency unit and early inpatient care.
              
                Results
                We identified studies that describe the unique burden of disease and challenges in delivering to the populations in these states, pointing to particular gaps in prehospital care delivery (both during scene response and during transport). Common barriers include poor infrastructure, lingering social distrust, scarce formal emergency care training, and lack of resources and supplies.
              
                Conclusion
                To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically identify the evidence on ECS in fragile and conflict-affected settings. Aligning ECS with existing global health priorities would ensure access to these critical life-saving interventions, yet there is concern over the lack of investments in frontline emergency care. An understanding of the state of ECS in post-conflict settings is emerging, although current evidence related to best practices and interventions is extremely limited. Careful attention should be paid to addressing the common barriers and context-relevant priorities in ECS, such as strengthening prehospital care delivery, triage, and referral systems and training the health workforce in emergency care principles.

"Knowledge, attitudes and practices of university students toward COVID-19 in Southern region, Afghanistan: a cross-sectional study","Rahmatullah Sirat, Mohammad Sediq Sahrai, Bilal Ahmad Rahimi, Abdullah Asady, Abdul Wahed Wasiq",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-023-04164-w,2023-3-20,['Kandahar University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Education']","['COVID-19', 'Disease Prevention', 'Higher Education']",,"**Summary of the Article on KAP of Kandahar University Students Regarding COVID-19**

**1. Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
The study was conducted during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Afghanistan, a time when public health measures and knowledge dissemination were critical, yet the capacity for widespread testing and reliable information was limited in the country.

**2. Purpose of the Research:**
The research aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of university students in Kandahar regarding COVID-19. It sought to identify gaps in information and potentially harmful practices that could contribute to the spread of the virus and to address misconceptions about the disease.

**3. Research Methods:**
The study employed a cross-sectional design, surveying students from a public university in Kandahar to evaluate their understanding and behavior concerning COVID-19.

**4. Main Findings:**
- A high proportion of students (91.6%) knew COVID-19 was caused by a virus, though misinformation persisted as 58.2% believed in using antibiotics for treatment.
- Social media emerged as the primary information source for over 81% of students.
- While 87.4% of students had a positive attitude toward protective measures, only 28.2% demonstrated good practices, with a significant majority (72.2%) engaging in high-risk behaviors.
- Disparities were noted in KAP scores based on gender and year of study, with males and students in higher study years generally performing better. However, females reportedly engaged in better practices.
- Self-reported COVID-19 prevalence (15.6%) was much higher than PCR-confirmed cases (3.1%), indicating a potential gap in diagnostic capabilities.
- Willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was 75.5%, higher than figures from some other countries.

**5. Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
There was a noted lack of effective public health measures, with initial community reactions being dismissive of the virus threat. Social distancing and other preventative practices were largely ignored in public gatherings due to insufficient knowledge and strong religious beliefs, contributing to poor COVID-19 practices among the public.

**6. Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
The authors highlighted the need for targeted health education campaigns to correct misinformation, especially regarding COVID-19 treatments. They stressed improving the availability and reliability of diagnostic centers to bridge the gap between self-reported and confirmed cases. Enhanced focus on preventive measures and public engagements could help in mitigating the spread of the virus.

**7. Limitations of the Study:**
The study had several limitations including:
- A gender imbalance with more male participants, which might skew the understanding of KAP across the student body.
- The cross-sectional design could not establish causality.
- The focus on a single university limits the generalizability of the findings across Afghanistan.
- The timing during the second wave might have affected students' KAP levels due to heightened awareness or fatigue from ongoing health campaigns.

Overall, the study underscores the critical need for improved health communication and systemic responses to address COVID-19 knowledge and behaviors in Afghanistan's educational institutions.","Abstract
                Background
                Successful implementation of preventive measures and level of awareness in particular among university students in Afghanistan could play a crucial role in spreading the information for better control of the ongoing pandemic. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the level of knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19 among Kandahar university students.
              
                Methods
                A cross-sectional study conducted among undergraduate students to investigate their KAP regarding COVID-19 from January to March, 2021. The data were collected using a structured questionnaire (socio-demographic characteristics, KAP questionnaire) by phone call interviews.
              
                Results
                From 359 participants, 88.9% were males, 81.3% were single, 65.1% lived in urban areas, and more than 64% of the students were less than 23 years old. Overall, 86.6% of the study participants had adequate level of knowledge and 87.5% had positive attitudes toward COVID-19. Almost one-third of the participants had good practices regarding COVID-19. All KAP scores were higher in male students. Significant difference of good practice (p &lt; 0.001) was observed among students who were in high socioeconomic status (SES) group. In univariate analysis, female sex (β: -0.75, p = 0.007) was negatively and watching television (β: 0.44; p = 0.014) was positively associated with knowledge score. However, in multivariate linear regression analysis, the knowledge score was significantly associated with age (β: -0.115; p = 0.004); attitude score was significantly associated with female sex (β: -2.776; p &lt; 0.001) and radio use (β: -0.974; p = 0.031); and practice score was significantly associated with female sex (β: -3.704; p = 0.002) and urban area (β: 1.702; p = 0.016).
              
                Conclusions
                The overall knowledge and attitudes regarding COVID-19 among university students were desirable. Higher university year, young age, male sex and living in urban areas were significantly associated with good KAP regarding COVID-19. Good practices towards COVID-19 should be increased through awareness programs.

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   The NAME (North Africa and Middle East) region, consisting largely of low and middle-income countries, faces significant challenges in healthcare infrastructure due to economic limitations and the impacts of armed conflicts. Such conflicts, particularly in countries like Afghanistan, Sudan, and Syria, exacerbate healthcare disparities and affect cancer diagnosis and treatment, as they disrupt healthcare services and infrastructure.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Challenges:**
   The research aims to analyze trends in pediatric cancer incidence, mortality, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in the NAME region. It addresses the human rights challenge of equitable access to healthcare services, emphasizing early diagnosis and treatment for childhood cancers, which are crucial given the disparity in cancer outcomes between lower and higher income countries.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study used data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 and 2019 studies to estimate incidence rates, mortality, and DALYs for pediatric cancers in the NAME region. It focused on categorizing cancers such as leukemia and brain/CNS cancers and compared regional data with global trends.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - The incidence rates of pediatric cancers remain constant, while DALYs and mortality are decreasing across the NAME region.
   - Leukemia and brain/CNS cancers are the most prevalent, consistent with global data.
   - High mortality rates were observed in countries like Afghanistan, Sudan, and Syria, highlighting disparities worsened by armed conflicts.
   - Gender disparities are evident, with males generally experiencing higher mortality relative to incidence rates.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   The study briefly notes the impact of economic and political instability on healthcare investments, but it emphasizes the importance of implementing targeted national cancer policies through initiatives like the WHO Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer. Recommendations include enhancing diagnostic and treatment capacities and focusing on early diagnosis.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The study concludes that despite progress in reducing mortality, significant disparities remain. Recommendations include increasing public awareness, improving healthcare infrastructure, offering better medical training, and focusing on early cancer detection, particularly in lower-income countries where late-stage diagnoses are more frequent. It advocates for international collaboration to address these issues.

7. **Limitations:**
   Identified limitations include potential inaccuracies in the GBD databases, especially in countries with less robust healthcare data collection systems. The study also lacks specific categorizations for certain pediatric cancers and does not cover the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the timeline of the data. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying causes of regional disparities in greater detail.","Abstract
                Introduction
                Despite the significant burden of childhood and adolescent cancers, no specific studies recently discussed the burden of cancer in this group in the North Africa and the Middle East (NAME) region. Therefore, we aimed to study the burden of cancers in this group in this region.
              
                Materials and methods
                We retrieved the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data for children and adolescent cancers (0–19 years old) in the NAME region from 1990 to 2019. 21 types of neoplasms were grouped as “neoplasms”, comprising 19 specific cancer groups as well as “other malignant neoplasms” and “other neoplasms”. Three significant parameters of incidence, deaths, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were studied. The data are presented with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI), and reported rates per 100,000.
              
                Results
                In 2019, almost 6 million (95% UI: 4.166 M–8.405 M) new cases and 11,560(9770-13,578) deaths due to neoplasms occurred in the NAME region. Incidence was higher in females (3.4 M), while deaths (6226 of overall 11,560) and DALYs (501,118 of overall 933,885) were estimated as higher in males. Incidence rates did not significantly change since 1990, while deaths and DALYs rates declined significantly. After excluding “other malignant neoplasms” and “other neoplasms”, leukemia was responsible for the highest number of incidence and deaths (incidence: 10,629(8237-13,081), deaths: 4053(3135-5013), followed by brain and central nervous system cancers (incidence: 5897(4192-7134), deaths: 2446(1761-2960)), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (incidence: 2741 (2237-3392), deaths: 790(645–962)). Incidence rates of neoplasms were similar for most countries, but countries varied more in terms of death rates. Afghanistan 8.9(6.5–11.9), Sudan 6.4(4.5–8.6), and the Syrian Arab Republic 5.6(4.3–8.3) had the highest overall death rates.
              
                Conclusion
                The NAME region is observing relatively constant incidence rates and a decreasing pattern in the deaths and DALYs. Despite this success, several countries are lagging behind in development. Different issues such as economic problems, armed conflicts and political instabilities, lack of equipment or experienced staff or poor distribution, stigmatization and disbelief in the healthcare systems account for unfavorable numbers in some countries. Such problems require urgent solutions as new sophisticated and personalized cares raise the alarm for even more inequalities between high and low-income countries.

The effectiveness of pay-for-performance contracts with non-governmental organizations in Afghanistan – results of a controlled interrupted time series analysis,"Diwa Samad, Bashir Hamid, Ghulam Dastagir Sayed, Yueming Liu, Wu Zeng, Alexander K. Rowe, Benjamin Loevinsohn",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-023-09099-y,2023-2-7,"['Fonds Mondial de Lutte Contre le sida, la Tuberculose et le Paludisme', 'Ministry of Public Health']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Maternal Health', 'Civil Society', 'Policy Reform']",,"1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The research is set in Afghanistan and covers health service contracts known as SEHAT (2015–2018) and SEHATMANDI (2019–2021). Afghanistan's health system, particularly during this era, involved international donors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working under various contracting mechanisms with the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) to deliver health services amidst ongoing conflict and political instability. The context is marked by efforts to improve health outcomes in a challenging environment with unique payment models like Pay-for-Performance (P4P) and the MOPH Strengthening Mechanism (MOPH-SM).

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions**: The research investigates the effectiveness of different contracting mechanisms in improving healthcare delivery, with a focus on reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health services. It addresses human rights questions related to the right to health, exploring whether financial incentives affect health service provision and quality in vulnerable regions.

3. **Research Methods**: The study used a mix of administrative data analysis, health facility surveys, and third-party verification. Data from the Health Management Information System (HMIS) was analyzed using segmented linear regression modeling. An independent third-party verified the data's consistency and accuracy through facility visits and patient interviews.

4. **Main Findings**: The study found high levels of consistency and accuracy in HMIS data in contracted provinces, slightly lower in MOPH-SM provinces. The introduction of P4P contracts did not deteriorate data quality. Quality assessments using the Balanced Scorecard indicated steady service delivery even during conflict peaks.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: While the study primarily focuses on contract effectiveness and service delivery, it alludes to governance issues by mentioning international donor involvement and the MOPH's role in overseeing contracts and verification.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors concluded that P4P contracts did not cause declines in service delivery or data quality. They recommend continued support for performance-based interventions but emphasize the need for robust third-party verification to ensure accountability.

7. **Limitations**: The study acknowledges contextual challenges, including potential biases from relying on HMIS data and the political instability following the Afghan government's fall in 2021. The security situation limited access to some areas, potentially affecting data representativeness. Additionally, the study does not directly analyze patient-level outcomes or individual rights but focuses on aggregate service data.","Abstract
                Background
                In many contexts, including fragile settings like Afghanistan, the coverage of basic health services is low. To address these challenges there has been considerable interest in working with NGOs and examining the effect of financial incentives on service providers. The Government of Afghanistan has used contracting with NGOs for more than 15 years and in 2019 introduced pay-for-performance (P4P) into the contracts. This study examines the impact of P4P on health service delivery in Afghanistan.
              
                Methods
                We conducted an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis with a non-randomized comparison group that employed segmented regression models and used independently verified health management information system (HMIS) data from 2015 to 2021. We compared 31 provinces with P4P contracts to 3 provinces where the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) continued to deliver services without P4P. We used data from annual health facility surveys to assess the quality of care.
              
                Findings
                Independent verification of the HMIS data found that consistency and accuracy was greater than 90% in the contracted provinces. The introduction of P4P increased the 10 P4P-compensated service delivery outcomes by a median of 22.1 percentage points (range 10.2 to 43.8) for the two-arm analysis and 19.9 percentage points (range: - 8.3 to 56.1) for the one-arm analysis. There was a small decrease in quality of care initially, but it was short-lived. We found few other unintended consequences.
              
                Interpretation
                P4P contracts with NGOs led to a substantial improvement in service delivery at lower cost despite a very difficult security situation.

Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D among children and adolescents of Kabul: a descriptive cross-sectional study,"Mohammad Sharif Sediqi, Abdul Rasheed Mansoor, Mohmand Mangal",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-023-03861-1,2023-2-1,"['Kabul University', 'Pediatrics Department']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Culture, Society, and Heritage']","['Nutrition', 'Disease Prevention']",,"1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The study highlights a significant health issue affecting Afghan children, emphasizing a broader, global health concern about vitamin D deficiency. This deficiency, prevalent in many parts of the world, particularly impacts regions with cultural or religious practices that limit sun exposure due to clothing norms. Afghanistan has a complex geopolitical landscape, and socioeconomic factors likely exacerbate public health challenges, such as nutritional deficiencies.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Challenges**: The research aims to assess vitamin D levels among Afghan children, addressing concerns about widespread hypovitaminosis D. This deficiency poses a human rights challenge as it affects children's right to health and well-being, potentially leading to developmental issues and other health problems.

3. **Research Methods**: The study involved measuring serum 25(OH)D levels in children from Kabul province to determine the prevalence and severity of vitamin D deficiency. However, the sample was not representative of the entire pediatric population of Afghanistan, and data on factors influencing vitamin D status were not collected.

4. **Main Findings**: The study found that over three-quarters of Afghan children suffer from varying degrees of vitamin D deficiency, with severe deficiency more common among females, likely due to clothing practices and reduced sun exposure. The prevalence in Afghan children is significantly higher than among children in the United States and other regions.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: While the article does not thoroughly explore Afghanistan's legal frameworks or policies regarding human rights and public health, it underscores the need for national health policies to address vitamin D deficiency.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that vitamin D deficiency is a critical issue among Afghan children and recommend vitamin D supplementation and policy interventions.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: Limitations include a non-representative sample limited to Kabul, lack of data on potential influencing factors such as diet and lifestyle, and a single-time serum measurement, which may not reflect year-round vitamin D levels. The political and social context of Afghanistan may also pose challenges in obtaining comprehensive data and implementing health policies.","Abstract
                Background
                Vitamin D is one of the most important fat-soluble vitamins necessary for normal growth and development of the human body. According to a study done in Kabul shows that economic, racial, and social concerns are thought to be the main impediments to receiving appropriate amounts of this vitamin through dietary sources in countries like Afghanistan. Hypovitaminosis D, on the other hand, is now recognized as a pandemic in both industrialized and developing countries.
              
                Methods
                To find out how common hypovitaminosis D is in children aged one month to eighteen years in afghan children Kabul, Afghanistan. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are defined as serum levels of less than 20 ng/mL and 20 to 30 ng/mL, respectively. Children aged between 1 month to 18 years attending our hospital, AMC (Ariana Medical Complex) for health examination were checked for their 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. Age, gender and address were recorded. 25(OH)D were determined using immunoassay auto analyzers. According to their serum 25(OH)D, the 25(OH)D were categorized into five categories: sufficiency: ≥ 30-100 ng/mL; insufficiency: ≥ 20-29 ng/mL; deficiency: &lt; 20 ng/mL; severe deficiency: &lt; 10 ng/mL; and intoxication: &gt; 150 ng/mL. Participants who were intoxicated with vitamin D were excluded from the study.
              
                Results
                A total of 4008 children aged 1 month to 18 years participated in this cross-sectional study. Hypovitaminosis D was found to be prevalent in 62.5 percent of the population. When compared to boys, female children were 1.2 times more likely to be vitamin D deficient. When compared to children of illiterate women, the odds of hypovitaminosis D were 1.4, 1.9, and 5.8 times lower in children with mothers educated up to primary school, graduation, and post-graduate. The average vitamin D level was 23 ng/mL, with a median of 15 ng/mL and maximum and minimum values of 135 ng/mL and 3 ng/mL, respectively.
                In all, 2500 (62.5%) of the children had low levels of vitamin D in their serum. Only 400 (16%) of the patients were sufficient, whereas 917 (36.7%) were severely deficient, 733 (29.3%) were deficient, and 450 (18%) were insufficient. With a female to male ratio of 1.2:1, the majority of those, 1335 (53.4%), were females and 1165 (46.6%) were males. Patients were 8.14 years old on average, with a median age of 7 years. The majority of the patients, 2152 (86.1%), were urban, while 348 (13.9%) were rural.
              
                Conclusion
                The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was very high in Afghan children. Female sex, higher socio economic status, higher educational status of the mother and living at urban areas were the factors with strong positive association with hypovitaminosis D.

                Background
                According to the World Health Organization, approximately 280 million individuals worldwide suffer from depression. One occupational group that is more prone to mental health issues is healthcare workers (HCWs). However, very little is known about the mental health of HCWs in Afghanistan. Therefore, the present study examined depression, quality of life (QOL), and related factors among Afghan HCWs.

              
                Methods
                A cross-sectional survey was administered in June 2022 among healthcare workers (N = 299) in the Herat province of Afghanistan. The survey examined depression, its risk factors and predictors among HCWs.

              
                Results
                Of the 299 participants, 73.6% of them reported depression symptoms. Low monthly income, working in a private hospital, and being a cigarette smoker were some of the main variables associated with depression symptoms among Afghan HCWs. Multiple regression analysis indicated that field of work (aOR = 3.774, p = 0.0048), monthly income (aOR = 0.746, p = 0.0088), job type (aOR = 8.970, p &lt; 0.0001), cigarette smoking (aOR = 2.955, p = 0.0069), a bad event happening during the past month (aOR = 2.433, p = 0.0157), physical domain of quality of life (aOR = 0.966, p = 0.0186), and psychological domain of quality of life (aOR = 0.950, p = 0.0005) were significantly associated with depression symptoms.
              
                Conclusion
                The prevalence of depression symptoms is high among healthcare workers in the Herat province of Afghanistan. One of the variables found to have a major impact on the prevalence of depression was their monthly income. Considering its impact on quality of life and the overall quality of healthcare services, the government should implement regular screening for depression, psychological counselling services, and psychiatric treatment for vulnerable healthcare workers.

The health consequences of civil wars: evidence from Afghanistan,"Mohammad Ajmal Hameed, Mohammad Mafizur Rahman, Rasheda Khanam",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14720-6,2023-1-23,['University of Southern Queensland'],Article,1,Yes,"['Security and Conflict', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Military Actions', 'Maternal Health', 'Disease Prevention']",,"Here is a summary of the article, including the specified points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The article discusses the impact of armed conflicts and civil wars on healthcare systems across various countries, including Iraq, Côte d'Ivoire, Nepal, Syria, and Sub-Saharan African countries. These regions have experienced significant historical and political turbulence, affecting their social and economic landscapes, especially healthcare.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research aims to address human rights challenges by examining the effects of armed conflict on healthcare systems, mortality rates, and access to healthcare services. It highlights the broader implications of civil unrest on human rights, particularly in terms of access to essential health services and the protection of vulnerable populations such as women and children.

3. **Research Methods**: The article summarizes various studies employing diverse methods such as surveys, questionnaires, observational methods, panel data regression analysis, and descriptive statistics to quantify and describe the impacts of armed conflicts on healthcare indicators.

4. **Main Findings**: Across the studies, several trends emerge: armed conflicts generally lead to deteriorations in healthcare systems, increased mortality and maternal death rates, and significant barriers to accessing healthcare. Notably, conflicts have disrupted healthcare delivery in Iraq, Syria, and Côte d'Ivoire. However, exceptions were noted in Nepal, where some health indicators surprisingly improved during wartime due to both conflict and non-conflict factors.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies**: While the article does not delve deeply into specific country legal frameworks, it implies a need to strengthen health-sector policies and institutional response in conflict zones to safeguard human rights more effectively.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that armed conflicts have pervasive negative effects on healthcare and socio-economic indicators, with particularly severe impacts on women and children. They recommend improvements in statistical methods used for analyzing conflict impacts and suggest a focus on protecting healthcare infrastructure and vulnerable populations during conflicts.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The article points out limitations due to varying statistical methods, potentially affecting the reliability of findings. Additionally, there is a noted lack of comprehensive data specific to Afghanistan, indicating a gap in the current literature regarding long-term impacts of conflict on healthcare in certain regions. The complex political climates in these areas also pose challenges to data collection and analysis.

Overall, the article synthesizes various findings from existing literature and underscores the critical need to protect healthcare systems and human rights during armed conflicts.","AbstractThis study examines the effects of long-run civil wars on healthcare, which is an important component of human capital development and their causality nexus in Afghanistan using the MVAR (modified vector autoregressive) approach and the Granger non-causality model covering data period 2002Q3-2020Q4. The primary results support a significant long-run relationship between variables, while the results of the MVAR model indicate the per capita cost of war, per capita GDP, and age dependency ratio have significantly positive impacts on per capita health expenditures, whereas child mortality rate and crude death rate have negative impacts. The results of the Granger non-causality approach demonstrate that there is a statistically significant bidirectional causality nexus between per capita health expenditure, per capita cost of war, per capita GDP, child mortality rate, crude death rate, and age dependency ratio, while it also supports the existence of strong and significant interconnectivity and multidimensionality between per capita cost of war and per capita health expenditure, with a significantly strong feedback response from the control variables. Important policy implications sourced from the key findings are also discussed."

This environment affects various aspects of life, including education and mental health, which are critical focal points in the study.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research aims to explore the relationship between school enrollment and child psychosocial wellbeing in Afghanistan. It addresses challenges such as how conflict and education access impact children's mental health, shedding light on human rights issues related to children's education and wellbeing.

3. **Research Methods**: A household survey was conducted across eight regions in Afghanistan using a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling method. In total, 4336 adults were surveyed, with a 90% participation rate. Surveys were administered by trained local staff in native languages (Dari or Pashtu), and data were collected on variables like terrorist threat levels, sociodemographic characteristics, and school attendance. Parents also filled out a Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to assess their child's mental health.

4. **Main Findings**: The study found significant correlations between school attendance and child mental health, with attendance linked to better psychosocial outcomes. The areas with higher terrorist activity saw worse outcomes in child mental health and lower school attendance. The study highlighted trends of educational and mental health disparities influenced by security risks and regional differences.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies**: The study indirectly touches on the inadequacy of current legal and institutional frameworks to ensure consistent access to education and protection from conflict-related trauma, emphasizing the need for stronger child protection laws and educational policies in conflict-prone areas.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The researchers concluded that improving school access, particularly in high-risk regions, is vital for enhancing children's mental health. They recommend initiatives focused on educational reform and psychosocial support systems, alongside a call for national and international efforts to improve security and educational infrastructure.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: Limitations include potential biases due to self-reported data, the impact of ongoing conflict on data accuracy, and logistical challenges in accessing insecure regions. The political climate and limited availability of data in conflict zones also constrained the study's breadth and depth.","AbstractBackgroundChildren in Afghanistan live in dangerous areas, and have been exposed to traumatic events and chaotic education. Progress has been made on access to education for girls who were the most affected by traditional attitudes against engagement in education.ObjectivesThe objectives were to evaluate the mental health of Afghan children living in regions of conflict and the association of mental health with school attendance for girls and boys.MethodThe study included 2707 school aged children in eight regions of Afghanistan (16 provinces) residing in households recruited through a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling strategy in 2017. The level of terrorist threat was evaluated by the intensity of terrorist attacks recorded that year in each province. Child mental health was assessed with the parental report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) along with information on school attendance, sociodemographic characteristics and geographic location.ResultsA total of 52.75% of children had scores above threshold for the SDQ total difficulties score, 39.19% for emotional difficulties, 51.98% for conduct challenges, and 15.37% for hyperactivity/inattention. Peer relationship problems were high (82.86%) and 12.38% reported that these problems impacted daily life. The level of terrorist threat was associated with SDQ total difficulties (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 4.08, P &lt; 0.0001), with youth in regions with high levels of terrorist threat more likely to have problems than youth in regions with low or medium levels of danger, independent of region and ethnicity. School attendance was negatively associated with emotional symptoms (AOR = 0.65, P &lt; 0.0001) and mental health difficulties with impairment (AOR = 0.67, P = 0.007), but positively associated with peer relationships difficulties (AOR = 1.96, P &gt; 0.0001). Conduct (AOR = 1.66, P &lt; .0001) and SDQ total difficulties (AOR = 1.22, P = 0.019) were higher among boys. Overall, gender did not modify the relationship between school attendance and child mental health.ConclusionAttending school is essential for children’s mental health, across gender, and should be supported as a priority in Afghanistan despite the return of the Taliban."

The review aims to uncover specific health challenges and human rights issues faced by this population, particularly in the context of the countries' healthcare systems.

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context**: The study is grounded in the context of significant numbers of Afghan refugees residing in Iran and Germany due to ongoing conflicts and socio-economic challenges in Afghanistan. These populations face unique challenges in accessing healthcare in host countries.

2. **Research Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The primary purpose of this research is to investigate the physical and mental health conditions of Afghan refugees, along with their access to healthcare services, in Iran and Germany. It addresses human rights concerns related to healthcare access, discrimination, and social determinants of health among refugee populations.

3. **Research Methods**: Utilizing a systematic review approach, the authors screened 922 studies, ultimately including 75 studies (60 from Iran and 15 from Germany) that met inclusion criteria. Studies were categorized based on relevance to physical health, mental health, and healthcare access and utilization.

4. **Main Findings**:
   - **In Iran**: The focus was on physical health, with communicable diseases like TB, Malaria, and hepatitis prevalent among refugees. There was a notable incidence of drug use and related high-risk behaviors. Non-communicable diseases such as kidney problems and cancer were significant, with food insecurity highly prevalent. Mental health studies indicated high levels of anxiety and depression, particularly among females. Barriers to healthcare access included cultural and financial factors.
   - **In Germany**: Fewer studies focused on Afghan refugees exclusively. Communicable diseases were common in refugee clinics, with a noted prevalence of antibiotic resistance. Mental health issues like depression and anxiety were widespread, exacerbated by traumatic experiences. Limited studies on healthcare access suggested high healthcare costs and unmet medical needs, especially among young refugees.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The study does not deeply explore the host countries’ legal frameworks but highlights gaps in refugee healthcare access, implying the need for policy improvements.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that Afghan refugees face substantial health and healthcare access challenges in both countries, calling for improved healthcare policies, better access to mental health services, and culturally sensitive care practices. Recommendations include more health screenings and prevention programs, particularly for vulnerable groups.

7. **Study Limitations**: The research faced limitations such as data availability, political sensitivity, and the generalizability of findings due to the diverse refugee demographics and varying healthcare policies in the countries studied.

This review highlights the pressing need for tailored healthcare interventions and policy reforms to safeguard Afghan refugees' health rights in host countries.","Abstract
                Background
                The re-emerging dominance of the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2021 caused a new wave of Afghan refugees heading Iran and neighboring countries. Iran in the Middle East and Germany in Europe are two major host countries to the largest populations of Afghan refugees. In both countries, several studies have been done to assess the health condition of refugees.
              
                Objectives
                To systematically review the existing literature to identify similarities and differences of health conditions of Afghan refugees living in the two countries, and to synthesize evidence on the health status and health care access of these populations.
              
                Methods
                Related electronic databases and grey literature of Iran and Germany on the health of Afghan refugees were scanned and searched up for the period 2000–2020. Key terms were formed by combining “Afghan refugees or immigrants or populations or asylum seekers”, “Physical or mental health”, “Healthcare service or access or use”, “Iran or Germany”. Empirical studies were considered if they contained samples of Afghan refugees with particular outcomes for Afghans. Results were categorized for both countries in the three main areas of physical health, mental health, and access/use of healthcare services.
              
                Results
                Nine hundred twenty-two documents were extracted, of which 75 full-texts were finally reviewed. 60 documents belonged to the health condition of Afghan refugees residing in Iran including 43 in physical health, 6 in mental health, 8 in healthcare access and use, and 3 in multiple aspects of health, and 15 belonged to Germany including 7 in physical health, 4 in mental health, 2 in healthcare access and use, and 2 in multiple aspects of health. A less explicit evaluation of the overall health condition of Afghan refugees was observable, particularly for Germany. While matches on the study subject exist for both countries, in comparison to Germany, we extracted more quantitative and qualitative health studies on Afghan refugees of the mentioned areas from Iran. German health studies were rare, less qualitative, and more on the health condition of diverse refugee groups in general.
              
                Conclusions
                Wide gaps and unanswered questions related to mental health and overall health status of the Afghan refugee population are observable, especially in Germany. Our systematic review identified the gap in evidence, which we would recommend to bridge using a wider lens to comprehensively assess the overall condition of refugees considering associations between health and socio-economic and cultural determinants instead of a one-dimensional approach. Further, within health studies on refugee populations, we recommend stratification of results by the country of origin to capture the within-group diversity among refugees with different countries of origin.

"North East England South Asia Mental health Alliance (NEESAMA): An exemplar of global north and global south collaboration to improve research, training and service delivery in mental healthcare","Meetali Devgun, Caitlin Kittridge, Shekhar Seshadri, Jacqueline Rodgers, Aditya Narain Sharma",https://doi.org/10.1192/bji.2023.22,2023-7-17,['Krea University'],Review,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Mental Health Services and Research', 'International Collaboration', 'Humanitarian Assistance and Knowledge Sharing']",,"### Summary:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Mental disorders affect nearly 1 billion people globally, with significant disparities in treatment access between high-income (global north) and low- to middle-income countries (global south). In the global south, mental healthcare is often deprioritized due to cultural stigma, limited resources, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. Conversely, the global north, exemplified by England and Wales, faces challenges with mental health service accessibility among its multi-ethnic populations.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges:**
   The research aims to address the significant disparities in mental health service provision between the global north and south by leveraging knowledge exchange. NEESAMA was formed to improve mental health care access, reduce stigma, and facilitate culturally informed interventions, emphasizing the fulfillment of mental health as a human right across diverse populations.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The NEESAMA initiative uses a partnership approach, promoting collaboration between South Asian and UK institutions. It involves annual meetings, professional exchanges, and establishing networks to evaluate and enhance mental health services. Research priorities include systematic reviews, epidemiological studies, and the development of valid, scalable mental health interventions tailored to cultural contexts.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The initiative has highlighted gaps in mental health service delivery, particularly for underrepresented groups like children, adolescents, and the elderly in South Asia. Cultural sensitivity in service provision and addressing stigma were identified as critical areas for intervention. Collaborative projects have led to improved understanding and publications on topics such as geriatric mental health and the pandemic’s mental health impact.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Institutions:**
   While the article does not discuss specific legal frameworks, it implies the necessity for policy integration and stakeholder engagement to ensure mental health service sustainability and accessibility within the participating countries' legal and healthcare systems.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   NEESAMA emphasizes the importance of integrating mental health into broader healthcare agendas in the global south and tailoring interventions to fit cultural contexts. Continued collaboration, professional training, and resource sharing across borders are recommended to address these mental health service gaps, thereby fulfilling the human right to health.

7. **Limitations:**
   The study acknowledges challenges such as data availability, low research participation, and political instability affecting mental health service implementation in partner countries. Cultural stigma and the lack of mental health professionals further complicate addressing mental health needs, demanding sustained focus and novel strategies to overcome these barriers.","Despite the worldwide burden of mental illness and recent interest in global approaches to address this, progress on increasing awareness, lessening stigma, reducing the treatment gap, and improving research and training in mental health has been slow. In 2018, the North East England South Asia Mental health Alliance (NEESAMA) was developed as a collaboration between high-income (global north) and low- to middle-income (global south) countries to address this slow progress. This paper outlines how the joint priority areas for research, training and service delivery were identified across the life course (child and adolescent, adults and older people) between partner organisations spanning Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the UK. It describes the progress to date and proposes a way forward for similar alliances to be forged."

Responses were scored ordinally (0, 1, 2) according to exposure frequency. Factor analysis supported item reduction and category consolidation yielding 28 exposure items in 5 categories. Generalised linear models with a logit link tested associations with symptoms (by respiratory health questionnaire) adjusting for other covariates. OR were scaled per 20-point score increment (normalised maximum=100).ResultsThe cohort mean age was 40.7 years with a median deployment duration of 11.7 months. Heavy exposures to multiple inhalational exposures were commonly reported, including burn pit smoke (72.7%) and VGDF (72.0%). The prevalence of dyspnoea, chronic bronchitis and wheeze in the past 12 months was 7.3%, 8.2% and 15.6%, respectively.

Aim: This study, supported by the United Nations Population Fund, was conducted to review available data associated with health indicators of Afghan mothers living in Islamic Republic of Iran. Methods: This descriptive study used data from the electronic registration system of the Maternal Health Office of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education on characteristics, morbidity and mortality among Afghan mothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran from 2017 to 2019. The data were analysed using SPSS version 23.0. Based on the results, we propose interventions to improve health services for vulnerable Afghan mothers. Results: There were 168 488 deliveries over the 3 years of the study (2017–2019). Deliveries by Afghan women increased from 3.4% in 2017 to 5.2% in 2019, and more than 70% of these Afghan women were vulnerable. Ten percent of deliveries among Afghan mothers were performed by traditional birth attendants. The rate of caesarean section among Afghan mothers was 30%. Maternal mortality ratio among the Afghan mothers was 43 per 100 000 for the 3 years. Conclusion: Afghan mothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran use primary health care services provided for mothers in the country. However, healthcare delivery to these mothers is inadequate, although considered better than the care provided to Afghan mothers living in Afghanistan. We recommend targeted interventions to improve the health status of Afghan women living in the Islamic Republic of Iran."

Association of Prehospital Neck Wound Survivability and Battlefield Medical Evacuation Time in Afghanistan,"Matthew W Paulson, Marika Rossetto, Jerome T McKay, Vikhyat S Bebarta, Kathleen Flarity, Sean Keenan, Steven G Schauer",https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usad080,2023-11-8,"['University of Colorado School of Medicine', 'Buckley Space Force Base']",Conference Paper,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"ABSTRACT
               
                  Introduction
                  The U.S. Military’s Golden Hour policy led to improved warfighter survivability during the Global War on Terror. The policy’s success is well-documented, but a categorical evaluation and stratification of medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) times based on combat injury is lacking.
               
               
                  Methods
                  We queried the Department of Defense Joint Trauma System Prehospital Trauma Registry for casualties with documented penetrating neck trauma in Afghanistan requiring battlefield MEDEVAC from June 15, 2009, through February 1, 2021. Casualties were excluded if the time from the point of injury to reach higher level medical care was not documented, listed as zero, or exceeded 4 hours. They were also excluded if demographic data were incomplete or deemed unreliable or if their injuries occurred outside of Afghanistan.
                  We designed a logistic regression model to test for associations in survivability, adjusting for composite injury severity score, patient age group, and type of next higher level of care reached. We then used our model to interpolate MEDEVAC times associated with 0.1%, 1%, and 10% increased risk of death for an incapacitated casualty with penetrating neck trauma.
               
               
                  Results
                  Of 1,147 encounters, 444 casualties met inclusion criteria. Of these casualties, 430 (96.9%) survived to discharge. Interpolative analysis of our multivariable logistic regression model showed that MEDEVAC times ≥8 minutes, ≥53 minutes, and ≥196 minutes are associated with a 0.1%, 1%, and 10% increased risk of mortality from baseline, respectively.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Our data characterize the maximum MEDEVAC times associated with 0.1%, 1%, and 10% increased risk of death from baseline survivability for penetrating battlefield neck trauma in Afghanistan.

A systematic review of the effectiveness and implementation readiness of psychosocial interventions for psychosis in South Asia,"Ying Zhao, Jinyi Liu, Ranbing Yang, Ting Guo, Jian Zhang, Wen Li, Linji Li",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0293567,2023-11-1,['Hainan University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Economy and Infrastructure', 'Technology']","['Agricultural Technology', 'Agriculture']",,"The article appears to be a technical analysis of the mechanical design and operation of a green soybean harvester, focusing on the drum mechanism's role in separating pods from stalks. Here's a summary based on the typical components of a research study, although this piece seems more like a technical report than a human rights analysis:

1. **Overview**: This article does not provide historical, political, or social context as it focuses on the mechanical aspects of agricultural machinery rather than human rights issues.

2. **Research Purpose**: The primary purpose is to design and analyze the mechanical efficiency of a green soybean harvester, particularly focusing on the separation of pods from stalks to improve harvesting quality.

3. **Methods**: The article outlines the mechanical analysis of the harvesting process, including evaluating parameters like drum height, rotational speed, and tooth comb configurations. The study uses principles of physics and engineering to optimize the harvester's performance.

4. **Main Findings**: The efficient removal of pods and reduced stalk entanglement are achieved by optimizing drum speed and geometry. Specific design considerations, such as the angle of stalk entry and exit from the harvester, significantly affect harvest efficiency.

5. **Legal Frameworks**: There is no examination of legal frameworks related to human rights within this article, as it is focused on mechanical engineering.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The article concludes with technical recommendations for improving the harvester's design, such as increasing the distance between the harvester and ground to enhance pod stripping and reduce losses.

7. **Limitations**: The study does not address limitations typically discussed in human rights research, such as political climate or data availability, since it is primarily focused on engineering design.

This article does not cover human rights topics but rather discusses the technical workings of agricultural machinery. As such, it lacks the components typically found in a human rights research paper, such as social or legal analysis.","To solve the problem of low efficiency of manual harvesting of green soybeans and lack of adaptable harvesters, in this study, a brushing-type green soybean harvester was designed. The comb-brushing type green soybean pod harvesting equipment is composed of a front-mounted separation drum, a full-width material delivery mechanism, a negative pressure cleaning system, and a stalk-pod separation system. Based on the operation requirements of the front-mounted brushing-type detachment drum, the drum parameters, parameters of comb arrangement, and structural parameters of the comb, the force analysis in detachment was performed. By taking the pod detachment rate and damage rate as the response indexes, the rotational speed of the drum, the travel speed of the device, and teeth distance as influencing factors, a three-factor five-level orthogonal rotary combination test was carried out by the software Design-Expert. By establishing mathematical regression models for various influencing factors and evaluation indicators, conducting variance analysis and significance analysis on the response indicators of each factor, the optimal parameters were obtained at a rotational speed of teeth of 397.36 rpm/min, minimum axial teeth distance of 4.8 mm and travel speed of the device of 0.5 m/s. Field test results showed that, under the optimal parameter combination, the pod detachment rate was 94%, the damage rate was 3.04%, the harvesting efficiency was greater than 0.187 hm2/h, and impurity content was less than 7.8%, all of which met the design and usage requirements. The research results can provide a reference for the design of soybean harvesters."

As opioid output sputters in Afghanistan, while Indian chemists increasingly normalise illicit fentanyl production in South Asia, opportunistic Pakistani chemists will be incentivised to supply synthetic opioids to high-demand international markets, just as Pakistani farmers supply opium and heroin to international clients. This convergence has ramifications for Pakistani law, drug enforcement and public health, as domestic production increases domestic access to synthetic opioids. The article conducts an empirical examination of current trends in South Asian opioid production, distribution and use, along with an exegesis of the legal and regulatory systems in Pakistan, Afghanistan and China. This study also details how the Pakistani government should respond to this challenge legislatively, foremost through blanket ban of fentanyl and its precursors. Pakistan can reduce domestic use through evidence-based treatment programmes, including discrete and confidential treatment administered by females to female users, opioid substitution therapy, safe needle exchange programmes, culturally sensitive drug awareness campaigns, and increased data collection to detect geographic hotspot locations of opioid use and overdoses.

The survey recorded subjective estimates of access to SRHR services, barriers to access, extent of maternal mortality or near miss due to preventable factors, and the effect of the regime change on access.ResultsThe data collection was interrupted after 60 responses. A majority of providers responded that their population went hungry often or always. According to our criteria for “access”, that 75% or more of the population was estimated to have it, no respondents (0%) assessed that access existed for services for gender‐based violence. The corresponding proportion responding that access existed was 3.4% for services after rape, 12.6% for legal abortion, 13.3% for antenatal care, and 20% for labor care. According to 41.7% of respondents, untreated postpartum hemorrhage accounted for a large or very large proportion of preventable maternal mortality or near miss. Almost half of respondents (47.4%) reported the same for lack of skilled providers, 66.2% reported it for the concept “too many pregnancies”, and 55% reported it for malnutrition and poor health. According to 43.3% of respondents, the regime change had reduced access to labor care to a large extent, 33.9% of respondents said this in relation to access to contraceptives, and 43.1% for overall access for internally displaced persons.ConclusionInterim data suggest that women in some settings in Afghanistan have no access to SRHR services, that preventable factors account for a large portion of maternal deaths or near miss, and that access has deteriorated since the transition of power."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to measure the epidemiological status and the burden of TB in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries.&#x0D;
Methods: The study population included 21 countries in the MENA region, covering a population of about 400 million. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 database was used. The case definition comprises all forms of TB, containing pulmonary and extra pulmonary TB, which are bacteriologically approved or clinically diagnosed. The prevalence, incidence, death, and the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates per 100,000 people for all national locations by standardized age rates (ASR) were measured.&#x0D;
Results: In 2019, Afghanistan had the highest TB-related incidence 85.09 (95% UI, 73.69_98.46), death 21.91 (95% UI, 13.44_29.78), and DALYs rate 695.21 (95% UI, 454.34_939.49). The highest prevalence rates of TB were in Egypt 28935.42 (95% UI, 26125.54_32251.01). The highest TB-related DALYs rate was attributed to alcohol use, high fasting plasma glucose, and smoking were related to Tunisia, Qatar, and Lebanon, respectively. Between 1990 and 2019, TB- related incidence, prevalence, death, and DALYs rate have decreased by 53%, 42.19%, 76.20%, and 75.95% in MENA region, respectively.&#x0D;
Conclusion: TB has continued to decrease in prevalence, incidence, death, and DALYs rates in the MENA region, although, nowadays with the COVID-19 pandemic, societies may face more challenges for TB prevention, detection, treatment, and rehabilitation.&#x0D;

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The health and well-being of UK Armed Forces personnel, both serving and veterans, are significant areas of focus for the UK Government, Ministry of Defence (MOD), and the Office for Veterans’ Affairs (OVA). This emphasis aligns with the Armed Forces Covenant, which aims to ensure members of the Armed Forces community are not disadvantaged due to their service. A legal obligation was established in 2022 for statutory bodies to consider the needs of this community.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   This research aims to understand the long-term health needs of UK service and ex-service personnel to identify health outcome trends and guide preventive strategies. This understanding is crucial for aligning both statutory and voluntary sector resources to support those in need within the Armed Forces community.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The research builds on the King’s Centre for Military Health Research (KCMHR) Health and Wellbeing Cohort Study, initiated in 2003, which began by assessing implications from deploying UK forces to Iraq. The study encompasses four phases of data collection, incorporating new samples and following participants through different deployment-related experiences, particularly from Iraq and Afghanistan.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The study intends to track the evolution of health outcomes across different phases of military service and post-transition into civilian life. This fourth wave focuses on maintaining a cohort representative of those who served during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts without adding new samples from the current Armed Forces, shifting the cohort to reflect legacy service and combat experiences.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   The study references the legal framework that underpins the mandate for statutory bodies to address the needs of the Armed Forces community, embedding this requirement in public sector strategies.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors underscore the necessity of long-term research to comprehensively address health issues faced by service personnel and veterans. Their recommendations highlight the importance of informed policies and resources targeted towards early detection and intervention to improve health outcomes for this group.

7. **Limitations:**
   The study doesn't include new Armed Forces recruits in its latest phase, focusing instead on a ""legacy cohort."" This approach might restrict insights into current service members' challenges but emphasizes historical service contexts. There are potential limitations due to the political climate, data sensitivity, and the availability of comprehensive data over such an extended period.","IntroductionThis is the fourth phase of a longitudinal cohort study (2022–2023) to investigate the health and well-being of UK serving (Regulars and Reservists) and ex-serving personnel (veterans) who served during the era of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. The cohort was established in 2003 and has collected data over three previous phases including Phase 1 (2004–2006), Phase 2 (2007–2009) and Phase 3 (2014–2016).Methods and analysisParticipants are eligible to take part if they completed the King’s Centre for Military Health Research Health and Wellbeing Cohort Study at Phase 3 (2014–2016) and consented to be recontacted (N=7608). Participants will be recruited through email, post and text message to complete an online or paper questionnaire. Data are being collected between January 2022 and September 2023. Health and well-being measures include measures used in previous phases that assess common mental disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol misuse. Other areas of interest assess employment, help-seeking and family relationships. New topics include the impact of the British withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, complex PTSD (C-PTSD), illicit drug use, gambling and loneliness. Analyses will describe the effect size between groups deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan or not deployed, and those who are currently in service versus ex-service personnel, respectively, reporting prevalences with 95% CIs, and ORs with 95% CI. Multivariable logistic and multiple linear regression analyses will be conducted to assess various health and well-being outcomes and associations with risk and protective factors.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval has been granted by the Ministry of Defence Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 2061/MODREC/21). Participants are provided with information and agree to a series of consent statements before taking part. Findings will be disseminated to UK Armed Forces stakeholders and international research institutions through stakeholder meetings, project reports and scientific publications."
A pre-Mongol New Persian legal document from Islamic Khurāsān dated ah 608/1212 ce,Zahir Bhalloo,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0041977X23000745,2023-11-6,['Universität Hamburg'],Article,1,Yes,"['Culture, Society, and Heritage', 'Governance']","['Religion', 'Traditional Practices']",,"The article appears to be a detailed examination of a historical court record from Khurāsān, written in Arabic and possibly Persian, which provides insights into the legal practices of the period. Below is a summary addressing the specified points:

1. **Historical Context**: The document is set in the context of Islamic legal traditions during the Abbasid period, focusing on court practices and judicial documentation, including the roles and signatures of qāḍīs (Islamic judges). The practice of using pious formulae as personal signatures (tawqīʿ) and related judicial documentation processes reflect the religious and legal milieu of the time, with comparisons to similar practices in Egypt and other regions.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research aims to explore the specific legal practices and judicial documentation in the Islamic world, focusing on how court records served as legal proof and the extent to which they adhered to the procedural norms prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence (shurūṭ). Although not directly addressing human rights as understood today, the document reflects historical practices concerning legal rights and procedures.

3. **Research Methods**: The study involves a textual and comparative analysis of historical court records, examining not just the content but also the physical layout and formulaic expressions used in these documents. The analysis draws on both the specific court record from Khurāsān and comparisons with other documents from regions such as Yārkand.

4. **Main Findings**: The findings shed light on the procedural regularity of court records, emphasizing the role of signatures, witness testimonies, and the written court decision. The qāḍī's consistent use of pious formulae and the form of judicial documentation point to a sophisticated legal culture that adhered to specific legal standards. This documentation served as a crucial means of authenticating legal outcomes and preventing subsequent disputes over rights.

5. **Legal Frameworks**: The study examines the function of sijill (final court record) and maḥḍar (initial court proceedings record) within Ḥanafī jurisprudence, noting differences across regions and periods. It discusses how the legal formulas used in the records reflect the procedural expectations set forth by legal scholars and documents.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that the court record from Khurāsān illustrates a well-established legal procedure and highlights the vital role of documentation in legitimizing judicial rulings. They recommend further exploration into regional variations in legal practices to better understand the diversity within Islamic legal traditions.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study’s limitations include the potential gaps in the historical record, such as a lack of comprehensive archival documentation that could provide a fuller picture of regional legal practices. Additionally, there is an inherent difficulty in interpreting the impact of broader political climates on local judicial practices, particularly given the sensitivity involved in historical legal interpretations.

This summary provides an overview of the historical and legal analysis conducted in the study, focusing on the procedural intricacies and historical significance of court records in the Islamic legal tradition.","AbstractSince the 1990s several caches of New Persian documents have come to light in Afghanistan. These documents, written on paper, are now the most significant sources for understanding how New Persian in Arabic script was used as an administrative and legal language in the eastern Islamic lands between the eleventh and early thirteenth centuries before the Mongol conquest of Khurāsān. After a brief survey of the three main collections in which these New Persian paper documents are preserved today, this article presents a preliminary edition, translation and commentary on one of the New Persian documents held in the Nasser D. Khalili Collection of Islamic Art. The document, dated ah 608/1212 ce, is a record of court proceedings and the decision of a judge (qāḍī) in a lawsuit over water rights initiated by a woman."
"Global, regional and national burden of traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury, 1990-2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019","Bin Guan, David B Anderson, Lingxiao Chen, Shiqing Feng, Hengxing Zhou",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2023-075049,2023-10-6,['Qilu Hospital of Shandong University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Governance']","['Disease Prevention', 'Financial Inclusion']",,"1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and spinal cord injuries (SCI) significantly impact public health globally, causing disabilities and economic burdens. While falls have been historically identified as leading causes in certain regions, conflicts in places like Afghanistan highlight the varying regional causes of these injuries.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research intended to offer the most recent data on the burden of TBI and SCI using Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2019 data, examining causes across 204 countries/territories and exploring associations between injury burdens and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI).

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study utilized data from the GBD 2019, calculating incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLD) for TBI/SCI globally through Bayesian meta-regression models. It also correlated SDI with injury burdens in various countries using Spearman correlation tests.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - Falls were the predominant cause of SCI in 97% of locations, with conflict and terrorism notably affecting a few regions like Afghanistan.
   - TBI incidences were mainly due to falls (74%), followed by road injuries. Regions with conflicts reported higher incidences due to terrorism and conflict.
   - From 1990 to 2019, global TBI incidence rates decreased significantly, linked to initiatives like improved road safety, while SCI rates showed no significant change.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   While not deeply examined, the study highlighted the impact of global and national preventive efforts, particularly concerning road safety and their role in reducing TBI rates.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The study emphasized the necessity for targeted interventions addressing specific leading causes of TBI/SCI per country. They noted the need for improved characterization of long-term sequelae from injuries and suggested more comprehensive data on lifetime prevalence and risk factors for future research.

7. **Limitations:**
   The study faced constraints due to reliance on hospital records, likely underestimating true incidences. Data-sparse countries relied on modeled estimates from richer data locales, potentially skewing specific outcomes. Additionally, the complexity of linking TBI/SCI with specific risk factors like alcohol use limited deeper analyses. The political situation in regions with poor data and ongoing conflicts further complicated accurate data gathering.","ObjectivesTo evaluate the most up-to-date burden of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) and analyse their leading causes in different countries/territories.DesignAn analysis of Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data.SettingThe epidemiological data were gathered from GBD Results Tool (1 January, 1990─31 December 2019) covering 21 GBD regions and 204 countries/ territories.ParticipantsPatients with TBI/SCI.Main outcomes and measuresAbsolute numbers and age-standardised rates/estimates of incidence, prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) of TBI/SCI by location in 2019, with their percentage changes from 1990 to 2019. The leading causes (eg, falls) of TBI/SCI in 204 countries/territories.ResultsGlobally, in 2019, TBI had 27.16 million new cases, 48.99 million prevalent cases and 7.08 million YLDs. SCI had 0.91 million new cases, 20.64 million prevalent cases and 6.20 million YLDs. Global age-standardised incidence rates of TBI decreased significantly by −5.5% (95% uncertainty interval −8.9% to −3.0%) from 1990 to 2019, whereas SCI had no significant change (−6.1% (−17.3% to 1.5%)). Regionally, in 2019, Eastern Europe and High-income North America had the highest burden of TBI and SCI, respectively. Nationally, in 2019, Slovenia and Afghanistan had the highest age-standardised incidence rates of TBI and SCI, respectively. For TBI, falls were the leading cause in 74% (150/204) of countries/territories, followed by pedestrian road injuries (14%, 29/204), motor vehicle road injuries (5%, 11/204), and conflict and terrorism (2%, 4/204). For SCI, falls were the leading cause in 97% (198/204) of countries/territories, followed by conflict and terrorism (3%, 6/204).ConclusionsGlobal age-standardised incidence rates of TBI have decreased significantly since 1990, whereas SCI had no significant change. The leading causes of TBI/SCI globally were falls, but variations did exist between countries/territories.

Salt Intake Estimation from Urine Samples in South Asian Population: Scoping Review,"Ummay Afroza, Ahmad Khairul Abrar, Abira Nowar, Jubaida Akhtar, Mohammad Abdullah Al Mamun, Sheikh Mohammad Mahbubus Sobhan, Laura Cobb, Nicole Ide, Sohel Reza Choudhury",https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15204358,2023-10-13,['National Heart Foundation Hospital and Research Institute'],Review,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Governance']","['Nutrition', 'Policy Reform']",,"The article provides a comprehensive review of salt consumption levels across South Asian countries and its implications for public health, particularly concerning non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The study highlights the role of the World Health Organization (WHO) in advocating for global salt reduction as a means to mitigate the rising burden of NCDs, which account for a significant proportion of global mortality. South Asian countries, undergoing rapid urbanization and dietary transitions, exhibit high salt intake levels linked to discretionary salt use and increasing consumption of processed foods.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research aims to compile reliable estimates of dietary salt intake in South Asian countries to inform and support salt reduction initiatives. It addresses human rights challenges related to health, emphasizing the need to reduce population-level salt intake to curb the incidence of NCDs.

3. **Research Methods**: The study employs a scoping review methodology, systematically collecting and analyzing research studies from South Asian countries regarding salt intake. The study included only research estimating salt intake through urinary sodium measurements—both 24-hour and spot urine samples—while excluding non-standard methods and non-nationally representative samples.

4. **Main Findings**: The review found that salt consumption in South Asian countries significantly exceeds WHO recommendations, with intake levels ranging from 6.7 g/day in Bangladesh and India to 13.3 g/day in Nepal. Men generally consume more salt than women. These high levels of salt intake contribute to increased risks of hypertension, CVDs, and other health issues.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The article highlights the lack of comprehensive sodium reduction policies in many South Asian countries, despite the WHO's recommendation to reduce salt intake by 30%. While some countries have made policy commitments, more robust policy development and implementation are required, including nutritional labeling and reformulation of processed foods.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that South Asian countries need effective salt reduction strategies, irrespective of the presence of nationally representative studies. They recommend strengthening policy frameworks, engaging multi-sectoral stakeholders, including civil society and media, and mandating sodium reduction in processed foods.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study acknowledges limitations, including a lack of data from the Maldives, exclusion of non-English studies, and the absence of meta-analysis. The political climate and limited resources in some countries may also hinder comprehensive data collection and policy implementation.

Overall, this review underscores the critical need for targeted interventions to reduce salt intake in South Asian populations to prevent chronic health conditions and promote public health equity.","The World Health Organization recommended reducing one’s salt intake below 5 g/day to prevent disability and death from cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. This review aimed to identify salt estimation at the population level in South Asian countries, namely Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. We searched electronic databases and government websites for the literature and reports published between January 2011 and October 2021 and also consulted key informants for unpublished reports. We included studies that assessed salt intake from urinary sodium excretion, either spot urine or a 24 h urine sample, on a minimum of 100 samples in South Asian countries. We included 12 studies meeting the criteria after screening 2043 studies, out of which five followed nationally representative methods. This review revealed that salt intake in South Asian countries ranges from 6.7–13.3 g/day. The reported lowest level of salt intake was in Bangladesh and India, and the highest one was in Nepal. The estimated salt intake reported in the nationally representative studies were ranging from 8 g/day (in India) to 12.1 g/day (in Afghanistan). Salt consumption in men (8.9–12.5 g/day) was reported higher than in women (7.1–12.5 g/day). Despite the global target of population salt intake reduction, people in South Asian countries consume a much higher amount of salt than the WHO-recommended level."

The literature describes TTP as an outcome of global political and security compulsions, Islamabad’s regional policies, and ideological associations with the Afghan Taliban. The present study adds terrain to the discussion. Islamabad, after militarily destroying TTP, announced the FATA merger in 2018. However, TTP’s revival not only problematizes the state’s role but also affirms the continuation of Zomian character: the nonstate spaces that facilitated TTP’s ability to regroup and thrive again.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The article is set against the backdrop of the UK's military involvement in Afghanistan, specifically within NATO's mission aimed at supporting Afghan institutions. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic added complexity to the existing military operations in the region.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions**: The research primarily addresses the operational challenges posed by COVID-19, including health and safety concerns for deployed troops. While it does not directly address specific human rights questions, issues around troop welfare could be interpreted as indirectly related to human rights discussions, such as the right to health and safe working conditions in military settings.

3. **Research Methods**: The article appears to rely on observational insights and the evaluation of implemented strategies, particularly focusing on medical planning and behavioral adaptations. It applies a structured framework known as the 4Ds and 4Cs for medical estimation and response planning during viral pandemics.

4. **Main Findings**: Key findings highlight the complications in managing occupational health and safety during a pandemic, emphasizing the importance of structured frameworks for effective response.

This generation of women’s legitimate military service as warriors began. The Afghanistan War period also exposed, however, the physical and emotional risks military women often face from their own colleagues on a global scale in the form of sexual violence.

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   Since 2015, Afghanistan has witnessed numerous armed conflict attacks on civilians, exacerbating its political and social instability. From September 2017 to August 2021, before the Taliban took power, Afghanistan's Ministry of Public Health worked on a health reform initiative as part of the country's National Health Policy 2015–2020. The policy aimed to prioritize health service improvements despite the prevailing insecurity.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Questions:**
   The research aims to examine Afghanistan's efforts towards universal health coverage (UHC) amidst conflict, focusing on the disparities in health service delivery and outcomes influenced by socio-economic and geographical factors. It addresses the human rights challenge of ensuring equitable access to health services for all citizens, especially marginalized groups.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study utilized data from national surveys, policy reports, journal articles, and a costing study to revise the basic and essential health services packages. Additionally, it involved collaboration with key partners to strengthen coordination.

4. **Main Findings:**
   Prior to the Taliban regime, significant improvements were made in reducing maternal and under-five mortality rates. However, insecurity notably hindered health service delivery, especially affecting maternal health and childhood vaccination coverage. Economic disparities resulted in uneven health services, with high out-of-pocket health expenses (76.5% of total expenditure in 2018). Notable health issues included the burden of communicable diseases, mental health disorders, and the impact of conflict-related injuries.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   The article discusses Afghanistan’s National Health Policy 2015–2020, created to guide health service improvements. However, the implementation of this revised health package framework was stalled due to the Taliban’s takeover in 2021.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors likely conclude that despite the policy-driven initiatives to improve health coverage, socio-economic and security challenges continue to impede progress. They might recommend targeted interventions to address these inequities and the health system's dependency on international aid.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The study's limitations stem from Afghanistan's volatile political climate and subsequent challenges in data collection. Changes after the Taliban takeover have hindered the planned policy implementations. Sensitivity around human rights issues poses additional challenges for gaining accurate and comprehensive data.","In 2017, in the middle of the armed conflict with the Taliban, the Ministry of Public Health decided that the Afghan health system needed a well-defined priority package of health services taking into account the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases and injuries and benefiting from the latest evidence published by DCP3. This leads to a 2-year process involving data analysis, modelling and national consultations, which produce this Integrated Package of Essential health Services (IPEHS). The IPEHS was finalised just before the takeover by the Taliban and could not be implemented. The Afghanistan experience has highlighted the need to address not only the content of a more comprehensive benefit package, but also its implementation and financing. The IPEHS could be used as a basis to help professionals and the new authorities to define their priorities."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Afghanistan has been engaged in extensive polio vaccination efforts as part of global initiatives to eradicate poliomyelitis. Despite these efforts, the country faces significant challenges, such as security instability, that affect public health initiatives.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Challenges**: The study aims to evaluate the progress and challenges of polio immunization in Afghanistan, addressing issues related to vaccination coverage and polio virus presence. It indirectly touches upon children's right to health and access to vaccines.

3. **Research Methods**: The study uses a combination of data from national immunization days (NIDs), environmental surveillance, and acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance. Data sources include vaccine coverage estimates, supplemental immunization activities (SIAs), and genetic sequencing of polio virus isolates to assess immunization coverage and virus spread.

4. **Main Findings**:
   - Immunization coverage for the three-dose oral polio vaccine (OPV) improved from 67% to 73% between 2022 and 2023, while the number of zero-dose children decreased.
   - Vaccination campaigns vary in success, heavily dependent on regional security conditions.
   - Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1) was detected in various regions, especially in the east, indicating ongoing virus circulation.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies**: Not explicitly detailed, but the study implies challenges due to restrictions in certain areas that limit house-to-house vaccination, suggesting an interplay between health initiatives and local governance.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors highlight improved vaccination coverage but indicate persistent poliovirus presence, especially in conflict-prone areas. They recommend continued surveillance and targeted immunization efforts, especially in regions with house-to-house vaccination restrictions.

7. **Limitations**: The study faces limitations due to the political climate, including security issues that restrict access for vaccination teams and difficulties in data collection. These challenges impact the accuracy and comprehensiveness of surveillance and coverage assessments. Additionally, the presence of divergent virus strains indicates potential surveillance gaps.

1. **Historical Context**: Military medicine in the U.S. has a long history, starting from the inoculation of troops against smallpox by George Washington during the Revolutionary War. Over time, it has developed practices used widely today in civilian health care, setting a precedent for treating diseases and injuries effectively in different contexts, from the battlefield to battling tropical diseases during the Spanish-American War, and introducing surgical techniques and technologies throughout the 20th century.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research aims to underscore the often-overlooked role of military medicine in driving forward civilian medical practices and public health. It seeks to address gaps in recognition and suggest reciprocal learning opportunities to enhance collaboration between military and civilian health sectors.

3. **Research Methods**: The authors reviewed historical records and published studies to cite notable examples where military medical innovations improved civilian health care. They highlighted specific advances achieved through focused, performance-driven research and collaborative practices like the Joint Trauma System and Tactical Combat Casualty Care.

4. **Main Findings**: Key findings emphasize how military medicine has halved the fatality rates for battle injuries, due to systems like the Joint Trauma System. Findings also highlight successful adaptation in civilian health care, such as the integration of tourniquet use and the COVID-19 response led by military teams.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: While the article underscores the efficacy of military practices, it calls for better integration of military and civilian health services through policies that ease transitions and encourage joint projects, such as those under the Defense Health Agency.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that enhanced communication and cooperation between military and civilian health sectors can expedite research and improve response capabilities to health emergencies. Recommendations include expanding military-civilian partnerships, increasing visibility and recognition of military health advances, and aligning trauma care standards.

7. **Limitations**: The study is limited by the military’s cultural emphasis on teamwork rather than individual acclaim, potentially hindering visibility and academic recognition. Additionally, the translation of innovations could be slower in civilian domains due to different operational and administrative practices.

In sum, the article stresses that despite its significant contributions, military medicine is often overlooked in civilian contexts, but improving partnerships and visibility can enhance both systems' practices and resilience.","ImportanceMilitary medicine in the US was established to treat wounded and ill service members and to protect the health and well-being of our military forces at home and abroad. To accomplish these tasks, it has developed the capacity to rapidly adapt to the changing nature of war and emerging health threats; throughout our nation’s history, innovations developed by military health professionals have been quickly adopted by civilian medicine and public health for the benefit of patients in the US and around the world.ObservationsFrom the historical record and published studies, we cite notable examples of how military medicine has advanced civilian health care and public health. We also describe how military medicine research and development differs from that done in the civilian world. During the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, military medicine’s focused approach to performance improvement and requirements-driven research cut the case fatality rate from severe battlefield wounds in half, to the lowest level in the history of warfare.Conclusions and RelevanceAlthough innovations developed by military medicine regularly inform and improve civilian health care and public health, the architects of these advances and the methods they use are often overlooked. Enhanced communication and cooperation between our nation’s military and civilian health systems would promote reciprocal learning, accelerate collaborative research, and strengthen our nation’s capacity to meet a growing array of health and geopolitical threats."

Gender and Forced Displacement in Humanitarian Policy Discourse: The Missing Link,"Anoji Ekanayake, Rajith Lakshman, Brad K. Blitz, Jiyar Aghapouri, Amna Javed, Maria Malik, Kiran Rahim",https://doi.org/10.1177/23315024231189487,2023-8-2,['University of Colombo'],Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available," Executive Summary  This paper reports on a study that examines how gender has been referenced in United Nations (UN), supranational and state documents on forced migration over the past 40 years. It is motivated by the premise that humanitarian protection discourses reflect broader institutional priorities and ideologies and may therefore expose gaps that reveal the relative importance given to the category of gender. The evidence presented below is the result of an extensive review of policy documents on Afghanistan, Kurdistan Region-Iraq (KRI), and Sri Lanka contained in the Refworld database. 1   The study sought to understand how gender is mentioned in terms of 1.  governmentality — a top-down policy preference, which emphasizes the management of humanitarian protection; 2.  empowerment — a bottom up policy preference, which emphasizes self-actualization and self-determination: we seek to understand how agency is expressed, including how opportunities for participation feature in policy discourse; 3.  inclusion — the scope of coverage of different gender categories in policy discourse; and, 4.  differentiation — the particularization of needs, wishes, and demands made by women, men, and girls and boys in displacement settings.  The paper finds: • Where gender and displacement are discussed together, there is greater emphasis on governmentality, which crowds out other objectives, including advancing opportunities for gender empowerment and participation. • Internally displaced persons (IDPs) tend to be treated as an operational challenge alongside security and peacebuilding. The nature of their displacement is implicit in these documents, associated within the recurring themes of land, violence, empowerment, and livelihoods. The documents mention violence, but do not widely cover maternal, sexual, and reproductive health. • The documents offer little insight into the identities of the displaced — whether female, male, children, or members of LGBT communities — and are mostly silent on their specific protection needs.  Overall, the paper finds remarkably little integration of gender within the humanitarian literature on forced displacement. In spite of much advocacy by the UN, the concept of gender has not been effectively disaggregated to address the specific needs of IDPs, especially in the discussion of children. This paper argues that taking gender seriously means recognizing how protection needs may be shaped by power relationships, and how policy and practice would be enhanced by a more nuanced understanding of how vulnerabilities and opportunities are structured by gender and the specificities of the displacement context. It recommends that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and partner UN agencies continue to find opportunities to bring humanitarian policy on gender and forced displacement into conversation in order to strengthen protection. To this end, it suggests that the concept of gender should be disaggregated to address the specific needs of displaced people, to reflect the wider range of identities of displaced people, and to foster opportunities for their empowerment, and participation.

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) is common in regions where malaria, particularly Plasmodium vivax, is prevalent. Historically, clinical trials in the 1950s established the 8-week primaquine (PQ8W) regimen to mitigate hemolytic risks associated with G6PD deficiency. The World Health Organization (WHO) endorses this regimen despite limited formal studies on its safety and efficacy.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the WHO-recommended 8-week primaquine regimen (PQ8W) for treating P. vivax malaria in patients with G6PD deficiency. It specifically addressed the challenge of recurrence and hemolysis in such patients, who are usually excluded from typical malaria treatment trials.

3. **Research Methods:**
   Conducted between July 2014 and November 2017, the multicentre observational study enrolled 50 patients with G6PD deficiency and confirmed P. vivax malaria in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Patients were treated with weekly primaquine along with dihydroartemisinin piperaquine (Indonesia) or chloroquine (Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Vietnam). G6PD deficiency was confirmed through genotyping. Data were analyzed using Stata and included descriptive statistics for hematological outcomes.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - The regimen was largely effective, with only two patients experiencing P. vivax recurrences.
   - Two significant hemoglobin (Hb) falls (>5 g/dL) were noted but patients recovered well and completed treatment.
   - The overall risk of malaria recurrence was significantly lower in G6PD-deficient patients compared to normal ones.
   - Genotypically confirmed G6PD variants were associated with similar safety profiles to G6PD normal patients treated with daily regimens but required clinical monitoring due to higher risks of hemolysis.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   While specific legal frameworks were not discussed, ethics approvals were obtained from local health authorities and international bodies. The study adhered to ethical guidelines across all participating countries.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The study concluded that the PQ8W regimen is a relatively safe and effective radical cure against P. vivax recurrence in G6PD-deficient patients. However, it noted the importance of clinical monitoring to quickly detect and manage hemolysis. It suggested that as G6PD point-of-care testing becomes more prevalent, the PQ8W regimen could be a viable treatment option for those unable to undergo daily treatment regimens.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   - The study had a small sample size, which limits its generalizability.
   - Data might be biased due to reliance on the FST (fluorescent spot test) for G6PD deficiency, which is prone to errors.
   - The inability to conduct spectrophotometric assays at all sites raised concerns about accurately measuring G6PD activity.
   - Political and logistical challenges in these regions could also limit the study’s broader applicability and influence data availability.","
Background
The World Health Organization recommends that primaquine should be given once weekly for 8-weeks to patients with Plasmodium vivax malaria and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, but data on its antirelapse efficacy and safety are limited.

Within the context of a multicentre, randomised clinical trial of two primaquine regimens in P. vivax malaria, patients with G6PD deficiency were excluded and enrolled into a separate 12-month observational study. They were treated with a weekly dose of 0.75 mg/kg primaquine for 8 weeks (PQ8W) plus dihydroartemisinin piperaquine (Indonesia) or chloroquine (Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Vietnam). G6PD status was diagnosed using the fluorescent spot test and confirmed by genotyping for locally prevalent G6PD variants. The risk of P. vivax recurrence following PQ8W and the consequent haematological recovery were characterized in all patients and in patients with genotypically confirmed G6PD variants, and compared with the patients enrolled in the main randomised control trial.


Results
Between July 2014 and November 2017, 42 male and 8 female patients were enrolled in Afghanistan (6), Ethiopia (5), Indonesia (19), and Vietnam (20). G6PD deficiency was confirmed by genotyping in 31 patients: Viangchan (14), Mediterranean (4), 357A-G (3), Canton (2), Kaiping (2), and one each for A-, Chatham, Gaohe, Ludhiana, Orissa, and Vanua Lava. Two patients had recurrent P. vivax parasitaemia (days 68 and 207). The overall 12-month cumulative risk of recurrent P. vivax malaria was 5.1% (95% CI: 1.3–18.9) and the incidence rate of recurrence was 46.8 per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 11.7–187.1). The risk of P. vivax recurrence was lower in G6PD deficient patients treated with PQ8W compared to G6PD normal patients in all treatment arms of the randomised controlled trial. Two of the 26 confirmed hemizygous males had a significant fall in haemoglobin (&gt;5g/dl) after the first dose but were able to complete their 8 week regimen.


Conclusions
PQ8W was highly effective in preventing P. vivax recurrences. Whilst PQ8W was well tolerated in most patients across a range of different G6PD variants, significant falls in haemoglobin may occur after the first dose and require clinical monitoring.

Overview and understanding of mental health and psychosocial support in Afghanistan,"Lyla Schwartz, Hannah Lane, Zainab Hassanpoor",https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihad055,2023-7-25,['Peace of Mind Association'],Review,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"Abstract
               More than four decades of war in Afghanistan has been both a main driver for poor mental health, and a barrier to the development of crucial mental health services. A study conducted by BMC Psychiatry in 2021, across eight regions in Afghanistan, found staggering levels of depressive and anxiety disorders among the general population. Almost one-half of those interviewed (47.12%) reported having high levels of distress in the last month, and almost 40% (39.44%) reported experiencing impairment to their lives due to poor mental health. Yet, despite the common experiences of much of the population, mental health is a hugely stigmatized topic of discussion in Afghanistan, due to a myriad of cultural, religious, socioeconomic and environmental factors. And now, under the de-facto Taliban government, mental health has been deprioritized in the face of a crumbling economy and acute levels of poverty, all but forgotten. This paper sought to review the impact and change to mental health services under the de-facto government, and to provide the reader with greater awareness into the current situation in Afghanistan and equip them with insight into how to respond to the mental health needs of Afghans."
Stochastic frontier approach to efficiency analysis of health facilities in providing services for non-communicable diseases in eight LMICs,"Muhammad Muazu Bala, Shailender Singh, Dhruba Kumar Gautam",https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihac080,2022-12-14,['SRM University-AP'],Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"Abstract
               
                  Background
                  The rising burden of non-communicable diseases presents an increasing public health challenge to many low- and middle-income countries. This problem may be compounded in health systems with lower levels of technical efficiency (TE).
               
               
                  Methods
                  This study used recent Service Provision Assessments data to estimate the level of TEs of health facilities in eight countries. Initially, the general and disease-specific service readiness indexes are estimated. Finally, the production function is estimated using the exposures and the outcomes of the model.
               
               
                  Results
                  Evidence shows that the general and disease-specific service readiness indexes are significantly associated with an increase in the number of outpatient visits. Outpatient visits may increase by 14% with an increase in health worker density. Similarly, outpatient visits may increase by 0.3% with a unit increase in the general and diabetes service readiness indexes. Furthermore, outpatient visits may increase by 0.4% and 0.8% with an increase in services readiness for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. respectively. Overall, the level of TE score suggests the need for improvement.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Facility-level service readiness for chronic diseases is quite low. Therefore, improving health outcomes related to chronic diseases requires urgent investment in high-quality health systems in these countries.

Association Between Combat-Related Traumatic Injury and Skeletal Health: Bone Mineral Density Loss Is Localized and Correlates With Altered Loading in Amputees: the Armed Services Trauma Rehabilitation Outcome (ADVANCE) Study,"Louise McMenemy, Fearghal P. Behan, Josh Kaufmann, David Cain, Alexander N. Bennett, Christopher J. Boos, Nicola T. Fear, Paul Cullinan, Anthony M.J. Bull, Andrew T.M. Phillips, Alison H. McGregor",https://doi.org/10.1002/jbmr.4794,2023-5-17,"['Institute of Naval Medicine, Gosport', 'Imperial College London', 'Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham']",Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"ABSTRACTThe association between combat‐related traumatic injury (CRTI) and bone health is uncertain. A disproportionate number of lower limb amputees from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts are diagnosed with osteopenia/osteoporosis, increasing lifetime risk of fragility fracture and challenging traditional osteoporosis treatment paradigms. The aim of this study is to test the hypotheses that CRTI results in a systemic reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) and that active traumatic lower limb amputees have localized BMD reduction, which is more prominent with higher level amputations. This is a cross‐sectional analysis of the first phase of a cohort study comprising 575 male adult UK military personnel with CRTI (UK‐Afghanistan War 2003 to 2014; including 153 lower limb amputees) who were frequency‐matched to 562 uninjured men by age, service, rank, regiment, deployment period, and role‐in‐theatre. BMD was assessed using dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning of the hips and lumbar spine. Femoral neck BMD was lower in the CRTI than the uninjured group (T‐score −0.08 versus −0.42 p = .000). Subgroup analysis revealed this reduction was significant only at the femoral neck of the amputated limb of amputees (p = 0.000), where the reduction was greater for above knee amputees than below knee amputees (p &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in spine BMD or activity levels between amputees and controls. Changes in bone health in CRTI appear to be mechanically driven rather than systemic and are only evident in those with lower limb amputation. This may arise from altered joint and muscle loading creating a reduced mechanical stimulus to the femur resulting in localized unloading osteopenia. This suggests that interventions to stimulate bone may provide an effective management strategy. © 2023 Crown copyright and The Authors.

Assessment of SAARC nations' solar energy potential for sustainable development,Ajay Mittal,https://doi.org/10.1177/0958305X221120935,2022-8-17,['University of Petroleum and Energy Studies'],Review,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available," Energy is very vital for the economic development and prosperity of any nation. Expanding a country's use of renewable energy sources can help it meet its current and future energy needs, as well as spur economic growth. Sustainable energy supply, electrification rate, population shifts, and per-capita power use affect economic development and prosperity. Electricity use is a key sign of a country's economic growth, and as the economy grows, so does the need for energy. Electricity generation relies on the availability of primary sources, implementation of technology as well as on policy imperatives. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation is the regional intergovernmental organization and geopolitical union of states in South Asia. Its member states are India, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan. SAARC countries are wealthy in natural resources, yet economic growth is a difficulty. This study aims to assess the solar energy potential of SAARC countries, which has received little attention. Prior research on solar energy possibilities in SAARC concentrated on one country or group. According to the study, SAARC countries rely heavily on imported fossil fuels and a single energy source. Renewable energy sources, especially solar energy, are important for their sustainable expansion, diversity of energy basket, energy security, and fulfilling rising electricity demand. The SAARC region has superior daily average horizontal sun irradiances than the UK and Germany, indicating untapped potential for solar photovoltaic systems. This study aims to encourage stakeholders to execute efficient solar energy governance planning for sustainable growth. "

"Post-traumatic growth amongst UK armed forces personnel who were deployed to Afghanistan and the role of combat injury, mental health and pain: the ADVANCE cohort study","Daniel Dyball, Alexander N. Bennett, Susie Schofield, Paul Cullinan, Christopher J. Boos, Anthony M. J. Bull, Sharon A. M. Stevelink, Nicola T.

   - The ADVANCE study involves UK Armed Forces personnel who were injured in combat during the Afghanistan deployment. Historically, the deployment period covers operations particularly significant in the UK military's engagement in the Middle East. This context is crucial for understanding the psychological and physical repercussions on soldiers who served in these demanding environments.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Questions:**
   - The study aims to investigate the long-term health impacts of combat injuries on UK military personnel, specifically focusing on mental health outcomes and post-traumatic growth (PTG). It addresses the human rights question of adequately supporting veterans' mental health needs after service-related injuries, highlighting any disparities in care and outcomes.

3. **Research Methods:**
   - The study follows a cohort of physically injured armed forces personnel alongside an uninjured comparison group. Generalized Structural Equation Modelling (GSEM) was employed to analyze relationships between combat injuries and mental health outcomes. PTSD, depression, and the concept of PTG were explored through a detailed questionnaire process, using weighted response data and various statistical techniques, including bootstrapping and mediation analysis.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - Those with non-amputation injuries reported poorer mental health outcomes, such as higher rates of PTSD and depression, compared to uninjured personnel. Amputation injury was notably associated with higher PTG than non-amputation injuries and the uninjured group. The study suggests that amputation injuries might receive more comprehensive therapeutic support, facilitating greater PTG.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   - Although the study does not explicitly examine legal frameworks, it implies the need for policies ensuring equitable and effective mental health support for veterans, including rehabilitation services that can facilitate PTG.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - The authors concluded that experiencing a combat injury, depending on its nature, significantly impacts mental health and PTG. Recommendations highlight the importance of enhancing psychological support for injured personnel, particularly non-amputees who may not receive adequate assistance, aiming to foster PTG and mitigate poor mental health outcomes.

7. **Limitations:**
   - Limitations include potential response bias, as those with worse mental health might be less likely to participate in studies. Furthermore, certain groups, such as women or non-combat personnel, were underrepresented. The study's cross-sectional design limits causative conclusions. External factors like political changes in Afghanistan could also affect long-term PTG and well-being.","AbstractBackgroundPost-traumatic growth (PTG) is a positive psychological consequence of trauma. The aims of this study were to investigate whether combat injury was associated with deployment-related PTG in a cohort of UK military personnel who were deployed to Afghanistan, and whether post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and pain mediate this relationship.Methods521 physically injured (n = 138 amputation; n = 383 non-amputation injury) and 514 frequency-matched uninjured personnel completed questionnaires including the deployment-related Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (DPTGI). DPTGI scores were categorised into tertiles of: no/low (score 0–20), moderate (score 21–34) or a large (35–63) degree of deployment-related PTG. Analysis was completed using generalised structural equation modelling.ResultsA large degree of PTG was reported by 28.0% (n = 140) of the uninjured group, 36.9% (n = 196) of the overall injured group, 45.4% (n = 62) of amputee and 34.1% (n = 134) of the non-amputee injured subgroups. Combat injury had a direct effect on reporting a large degree of PTG [Relative risk ratio (RRR) 1.59 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17–2.17)] compared to sustaining no injury. Amputation injuries also had a significant direct effect [RRR 2.18 (95% CI 1.24–3.75)], but non-amputation injuries did not [RRR 1.35 (95% CI 0.92–1.93)]. PTSD, depression and pain partially mediate this relationship, though mediation differed depending on the injury subtype. PTSD had a curvilinear relationship with PTG, whilst depression had a negative association and pain had a positive association.ConclusionsCombat injury, in particular injury resulting in traumatic amputation, is associated with reporting a large degree of PTG."
Attachment and trauma-informed programme to support forcibly displaced parents of youth in Sweden: Feasibility and preliminary outcomes of the eConnect Online programme,"Anna Kristen, Raziye Salari, Marlene Moretti, Fatumo Osman",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2023-072368,2023-8-7,['Simon Fraser University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance', 'Technology']","['Migration', 'COVID-19']",,"The article discusses a study on the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of the eConnect Online programme, an adaptation of the Connect parenting intervention designed for forcibly displaced parents in Sweden, particularly amidst the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Connect programme, historically effective in addressing youth mental health issues, was delivered virtually to overcome barriers to access for underserved populations, especially those compounded by the pandemic.

1. **Context**: The study highlights the global issue of forced displacement driven by conflict and human rights violations, affecting over 89 million people, with significant representation of youth. In Sweden, forcibly displaced persons face challenges including integration stress, systemic racism, and healthcare access issues, particularly worsened during COVID-19 due to public health restrictions.

2. **Purpose**: The research aims to evaluate an online version of the Connect programme for refugee parents, addressing challenges such as poor service accessibility, lack of culturally aligned services, and pre-existing traumas and stigmas surrounding mental health in these communities.

3. **Methods**: The study used a single-arm feasibility design, assessing pre- and post-intervention outcomes. Parents were recruited from municipal activities, and 23 out of 28 eligible parents were retained for study measures. Attendance, completion rates, and focus group interviews gauged feasibility and acceptability. Descriptive statistics and repeated measures ANOVA analyses were applied to assess program impact on mental health outcomes.

4. **Findings**: The findings indicated significant improvements in youth mental health, particularly in externalizing problems and family functioning, but unexpectedly increased attachment anxiety in parent-child relationships. While over 50% of parents were familiar with videoconferencing technology, technological challenges persisted, especially for Dari-speaking newer migrants.

5. **Legal Framework/Institutional Examination**: The study doesn't directly address national legal frameworks or policies, but it underscores the need for culturally sensitive and accessible services in the host country's healthcare system.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that eConnect is a promising method for reducing service access disparities for forcibly displaced families. They recommend further research to develop culturally appropriate measurement tools and emphasize the importance of shared language and lived experiences in service delivery. The findings call for improved technological access and literacy support for displaced families.

7. **Limitations**: The study's limitations include a small sample size, lack of a control group, and unvalidated attachment measures for the target population. These highlight challenges including data availability, cultural translation of measures, and the political climate affecting participant engagement.

Overall, the study emphasizes the potential of virtual interventions like eConnect to enhance mental health outcomes among refugee populations while addressing barriers to service access, despite facing notable limitations linked to technology use and cultural differences.","ObjectivesTo assess the feasibility, acceptability and the impact of an online parenting programme for forcibly displaced parents of adolescents.DesignThe study was a single-arm feasibility study using pre-intervention post-intervention and follow-up assessments.SettingParticipants were recruited from municipality-based activities for refugee parents in a small city in the south of Sweden.ParticipantsParticipants were forcibly displaced parents (n=23; 47.8% maternal figures) of youth (n=23; 8–17 years old; 26.1% female) from Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia participating in an online parenting programme (eConnect).InterventioneConnectis an attachment-based and trauma-informed parenting intervention and was delivered over the course of 10 weekly sessions.Primary and secondary outcome measuresFeasibility was assessed by programme enrolment, attendance, completion and acceptability of the online platform and cultural fit of the programme.

            OBJECTIVES
            The objective of this study is to describe the United States and allied military medical response during the withdrawal from Afghanistan.
          
          
            BACKGROUND
            The military withdrawal from Afghanistan concluded with severe hostilities resulting in numerous civilian and military casualties. The clinical care provided by coalition forces capitalized on decades of lessons learned and enabled unprecedented accomplishments.
          
          
            METHODS
            In this retrospective, observational analysis, casualty numbers, and operative information was collected and reported from military medical assets in Kabul, Afghanistan. The continuum of medical care and the trauma system, from the point of injury back to the United States was captured and described.
          
          
            RESULTS
            Prior to a large suicide bombing resulting in a mass casualty event, the international medical teams managed distinct 45 trauma incidents involving nearly 200 combat and non-combat civilian and military patients over the preceding 3 months. Military medical personnel treated 63 casualties from the Kabul airport suicide attack and performed 15 trauma operations. US air transport teams evacuated 37 patients within 15 hours of the attack.
          
          
            CONCLUSION
            Lessons learned from the last 20 years of combat casualty care were successfully implemented during the culmination of the Afghanistan conflict. Ultimately, the effort, teamwork, and system adaptability exemplify not only the attitudes and character of service members who provide modern combat casualty care but also the paramount importance of the battlefield learning health care system. A continued posture to maintain military surgical preparedness in unique environments remain crucial as the US military prepares for the future.

Introduction
This study aimed to identify the factors associated with the coverage of the third dose of pentavalent vaccine (Penta3) among children aged 12–23 months in Afghanistan.


Methods
The data of 3,040 children aged 12–23 months were taken from the Afghanistan Health Survey 2018, including characteristics of the children and their households, household heads, and mothers/primary care givers. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a logistic model. Multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis with forward-selection (Model 1) and backward-selection (Model 2) was performed using variables that showed significant differences by bivariate analysis.


Results
The coverage of Penta3 among 12–23-month-old children was 82.3%. Factors associated with Penta3 coverage in the two models of multivariable analysis were 18–23 months old compared to 12–17 months old; having no diarrhea in the last two weeks compared to having diarrhea; no bipedal edema compared to having edema; taking vitamin A supplement; 1–2 children under five years in a household compared to three or more; distance from residence to the nearest health facility ≤2 hours on foot; having a radio; having a TV; educated heads of households; non-smoking of heads of households; and literacy of mothers/primary caregivers.


Conclusions
Penta3 coverage among 12–23-month-old children improved but was still lower than the target. Primary education should be provided to all children throughout the country. TV and radio are useful tools for providing health information. Mobile outreach programs and the establishment of new health facilities should be promoted to improve access to health service for all people in Afghanistan.

            ABSTRACT
            Humanitarian care is a vital component of the wartime mission. Children comprise a significant proportion of casualties injured by explosives and penetrating weapons. Children face a variety of unique injury patterns in the combat setting as high-powered firearms and explosives are rarely seen in the civilian setting. We sought to perform a scoping review of pediatric research from the recent US-led wars in Afghanistan, and Iraq conflicts beginning in 2001. We used Google Scholar and PubMed to identify pediatric combat literature published between 2001 and 2022. We utilized the PRISMA-ScR Checklist to conduct this review. We identified 52 studies that met inclusion for this analysis—1 prospective observational study, 50 retrospective studies, and 1 case report. All the original research studies were retrospective in nature except for one. We identified one prospective study that was a post hoc subanalysis from an overall study assessing the success of prehospital lifesaving interventions. Most of the articles came from varying registries created by the United States and British militaries for the purposes of trauma performance improvement. The deployed health service support mission often includes treatment of pediatric trauma patients. The deployed health service support mission often includes treatment of pediatric trauma patients. We found that available literature from this setting is limited to retrospective studies except for one prospective study. Our findings suggest that pediatric humanitarian care was a significant source of medical resource consumption within both of the major wars. Further, many of the lessons learned have directly translated into changes in civilian pediatric trauma care practices highlighting the need for collaborative scientific developments between the military and civilian trauma programs.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further strained this system, complicating the management of pregnancy-related conditions like preeclampsia, a significant cause of maternal mortality in the country.

2. **Purpose of the Research:** The article examines the challenges in diagnosing and managing preeclampsia in Afghanistan, heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic. It addresses human rights issues related to maternal health, particularly the right to access adequate healthcare services.

3. **Research Methods Used:** The research references the Afghanistan Mortality Survey and other studies assessing healthcare quality, maternal outcomes, and the impact of COVID-19 on preeclampsia management. It reviews statistical data and case studies highlighting the maternal health crisis.

4. **Main Findings:** Afghanistan's maternal mortality rate is significantly affected by preeclampsia, exacerbated by the pandemic. Limited access to quality healthcare, poor antenatal care practices, and a struggling healthcare system contribute to the high incidence of maternal and perinatal complications. The COVID-19 pandemic has notably worsened these challenges.

5. **Country’s Legal Frameworks and Policies:** While not specifically examined in-depth, the article implies that Afghanistan's healthcare policies and infrastructures are inadequate in addressing maternal health rights and need significant improvement.

6. **Authors’ Conclusions and Recommendations:** The authors conclude that investing in Afghanistan's healthcare system is critical, emphasizing enhanced access to reproductive health services and skilled birth attendants. They call for a collaborative effort from government, healthcare providers, and communities to improve maternal health outcomes and reduce preeclampsia-related complications.

7. **Limitations of the Study:** Limitations include data availability and the sensitivity of human rights issues exacerbated by Afghanistan's political climate.

Breaching the family walls: Modelling the impact of prolonged visa insecurity on asylum-seeking children,"Lux Ratnamohan, Derrick Silove, Sarah Mares, Yalini Krishna, Dusan Hadzi-Pavlovic, Zachary Steel",https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221148399,2023-1-12,"['University of New South Wales Faculty of Medicine, School of Psychiatry', 'Thomas Walker Hospital']",Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"Objective: Children in asylum-seeking families are increasingly subject to deterrent host nation policies that undermine security in the post-migration context, however, little is known on the mental health consequences of such policy. This study examined the impact of prolonged visa insecurity on child mental health, by comparing two cohorts of refugee children entering Australia between 2010 and 2013, distinguished by visa security. Methods: The insecure visa sample comprised children from Tamil asylum-seeking families, while the secure visa sample was drawn from refugee families participating in the multi-ethnic ‘Building a New Life in Australia’ cohort study. Children in each sample were assessed for current mental health problems and trauma exposure. Mothers were assessed for trauma exposure, post-migration family stressors and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The effects of prolonged visa insecurity on child mental health via family-and child-level variables were modelled using multi-level path analysis. Results: Data comprised 361 children, aged 10–18, and 242 mothers across three levels of visa insecurity: permanent protection ( n = 293), temporary protection ( n = 40) and bridging visa ( n = 28). Modelling showed that (1) visa insecurity was associated with poorer child mental health, (2) the association was mediated sequentially by post-migration family stressors and maternal PTSD and (3) the association was moderated by maternal PTSD. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that when government policy persistently undermines post-migration security, the capacity of families to protect children from accrued stressors is lowered, leaving a significantly higher proportion of children developing along trajectories of risk rather than resilience.

The Taliban's return to power in August 2021 has led to severe restrictions on the rights of women and girls, prompting international concern about whether they qualify for refugee status.

1. **Context**: The Taliban, previously in power from 1996 to 2001, returned to control Afghanistan in 2021, leading to widespread human rights abuses, particularly against women and girls. Their rights to education, work, and freedom have been curbed, sparking international debates on refugee status eligibility.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The research addresses whether the Taliban's actions amount to persecution, qualifying Afghan women and girls for refugee status as a ""particular social group"" under international law. It seeks to determine whether these women and girls should be presumed refugees, simplifying asylum procedures.

3. **Methods**: The study involves legal analysis of international conventions, such as the 1951 Refugee Convention, along with case studies from various countries on how they interpret refugee claims by Afghan women and girls. 

4. **Main Findings**: The Taliban's treatment is deemed persecution based on gender. Various countries, including Sweden and Finland, have already started recognizing Afghan women and girls as deserving of refugee status. The United Nations and the European Union (EU) have also acknowledged that current measures amount to persecution.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The article examines the responses of different legal systems to Afghan asylum claims, finding initial reluctance due to the requirement for individual assessments but noting a shift towards recognizing group persecution.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that Afghan women and girls should be recognized as refugees on a group basis, suggesting simplified or accelerated asylum procedures. The study argues for prima facie recognition of their refugee status to streamline protection and reduce administrative burdens on asylum states.

7. **Limitations**: Challenges include political considerations affecting asylum decisions, the practicalities of recognizing a large group as refugees, and differing national laws on interpreting refugee status, especially within the EU.

The article advocates for recognizing Afghan women and girls as refugees due to the clear persecution they face, promoting legal and procedural adaptations to expedite their asylum processes.","AbstractThe Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021 deprived women and girls of their fundamental rights. The Taliban denied or severely restricted women and girls’ rights to education, work, healthcare, freedom of movement, opinion and expression, and to protection from gender-based violence. This article argues that the Taliban's treatment of Afghan women and girls amounts to persecution, and all Afghan women and girls should be recognised as refugees under the 1951 Refugee Convention. The article further examines the feasibility of prima facie recognition for Afghan women and girls."

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context**: 
   Afghanistan has endured decades of conflict, with ongoing instability deeply impacting its population's mental health. Political turmoil, war, and displacement have created pervasive psychological trauma among Afghans and refugees, necessitating an urgent focus on mental health issues within this context.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: 
   The research aims to explore the mental health challenges faced by Afghans, both within the country and among refugee populations. It seeks to address specific human rights questions related to access to mental health care and the culturally specific needs of these groups, highlighting the broader implications for human rights in the context of healthcare.

3. **Research Methods**: 
   The study involved a comprehensive review of 214 papers, categorizing them into distinct groups based on their relation to Afghanistan and refugees. This included analysis of academic publications, dissertations, and grey literature such as governmental and NGO reports. The research is presented in two parts: epidemiological data on Afghan mental health, and an examination of mental healthcare systems and interventions.

4. **Main Findings**: 
   The study identifies significant mental health issues among Afghans, exacerbated by conflict and displacement. It highlights a lack of adequate mental healthcare services and support systems, which contributes to ongoing human rights challenges. The analysis underscores a trend of insufficient culturally sensitive psychological interventions and community-based support systems.

5. **Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies**: 
   Although the article does not deeply delve into Afghan legal frameworks, it implies that existing policies and institutions are inadequate in addressing the mental health needs compounded by human rights violations and systemic healthcare deficiencies.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: 
   The authors conclude that there is an urgent need for enhanced mental healthcare systems in Afghanistan, emphasizing culturally appropriate interventions. Recommendations include integrating community-based psychosocial support and expanding psychological services to better address the mental health crisis among Afghans and refugee populations.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: 
   The study's limitations primarily relate to the complex political climate of Afghanistan, which affects data availability and the implementation of mental healthcare initiatives. Additionally, the sensitivity of human rights issues and the challenges in accessing reliable data due to ongoing conflict potentially constrain the research findings.

This summary captures the essence of the article by outlining the critical elements of the research on Afghan mental health and the associated human rights considerations.","BackgroundFour decades of war, political upheaval, economic deprivation and forced displacement have profoundly affected both in-country and refugee Afghan populations.AimsWe reviewed literature on mental health and psychosocial well-being, to assess the current evidence and describe mental healthcare systems, including government programmes and community-based interventions.MethodIn 2022, we conducted a systematic search in Google Scholar, PTSDpubs, PubMed and PsycINFO, and a hand search of grey literature (N= 214 papers). We identified the main factors driving the epidemiology of mental health problems, culturally salient understandings of psychological distress, coping strategies and help-seeking behaviours, and interventions for mental health and psychosocial support.ResultsMental health problems and psychological distress show higher risks for women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities and youth. Issues of suicidality and drug use are emerging problems that are understudied. Afghans use specific vocabulary to convey psychological distress, drawing on culturally relevant concepts of body–mind relationships. Coping strategies are largely embedded in one's faith and family. Over the past two decades, concerted efforts were made to integrate mental health into the nation's healthcare system, train cadres of psychosocial counsellors, and develop community-based psychosocial initiatives with the help of non-governmental organisations. A small but growing body of research is emerging around psychological interventions adapted to Afghan contexts and culture.ConclusionsWe make four recommendations to promote health equity and sustainable systems of care. Interventions must build cultural relevance, invest in community-based psychosocial support and evidence-based psychological interventions, maintain core mental health services at logical points of access and foster integrated systems of care."
Recovery of Routine Immunisation: Mapping External Financing Opportunities for Reaching Zero-Dose Children,"Sarah Tougher, Nikhil Mandalia, Ulla Kou Griffiths",https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11071159,2023-6-26,[],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Disease Prevention', 'Financial Inclusion', 'International Community']",,"### Summary of the Article on Finance Mapping in Immunisation Activities

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   - The article discusses a historical decline in childhood vaccination coverage, marking the largest sustained decrease in three decades. It addresses the challenge of reaching ""zero-dose"" children—those who have not received any vaccinations.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges:**
   - The primary aim of the study is to enhance transparency in external funding for immunisation in countries with a high population of zero-dose children. The research seeks to address human rights issues related to equitable access to healthcare, specifically vaccination services.

3. **Research Methods Used:**
   - A 'top-down' approach was employed, where external funding organizations were solicited for information on their financial contributions to countries. This method aimed to be less resource-intensive than direct engagement at country levels. Insights were gathered on current and potentially unallocated funds from sources such as Gavi, the World Bank, UNICEF, and others.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - Twenty countries with the most zero-dose children have varying access to external financing. Many countries rely heavily on foreign aid due to limited domestic resources for health. There are disparities in funding allocations, with some countries like Brazil and Mexico having no access to external funds apart from loans.
   - Financial support from various global initiatives has been outlined, including Gavi, World Bank projects, and other targeted grants for immunisation.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   - While not explicitly detailed in the article, the discussion highlights the coordination roles of Ministries of Health and Finance in donor funding applications, indicating variations in national capacities to manage and align external funding with national health agendas.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - The authors call for improved donor coordination and transparency in fund disbursement to enhance immunisation coverage and support recovery efforts post-COVID-19. Public disclosure of funding information is recommended to foster accountability and facilitate operational planning between governments and donors.

7. **Limitations:**
   - Key limitations include data availability and transparency issues, which hinder comprehensive evaluations. Different financial mechanisms had varying levels of accessible data, complicating synthesis across sources. These challenges were further exacerbated by political and operational constraints within countries, impacting the study's timeliness and depth.

The article underscores the importance of financial transparency in programs targeting zero-dose children, advocating for collaborative efforts to improve vaccine coverage and address health disparities.","The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated large declines in childhood vaccination coverage and, consequently, substantial increases in the number of zero-dose children. To effectively respond to these declines, it is necessary to direct resources for recovery. We mapped active external financing for immunisation and primary healthcare in 20 countries with the highest numbers of zero-dose children to promote transparency and donor coordination. We found that countries have disparate access to external financing, with the two upper-middle-income countries (Brazil and Mexico) only having access to loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Domestic resource mobilization is, therefore, key in these two countries, although fiscal space is likely constrained. Four additional countries (Angola, Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam) do not have allocations from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance for Health Systems Strengthening, or Equity Accelerator Funding, but are eligible for support under Gavi’s Middle-Income Countries Approach. Our methods, which focus on current donor financing, are novel and reveal substantial variations in access to external financing to support immunisation in high-burden countries. The available data differ considerably across financing mechanisms, making it difficult to synthesise the results across funding sources."
"What Are the Characteristics of Torture Victims in Recently Arrived Refugees? A Cross-Sectional Study of Newly Arrived Refugees in Aarhus, Denmark","Mette Hvidegaard, Kamilla Lanng, Karin Meyer, Christian Wejse, Anne Mette Fløe Hvass",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20146331,2023-7-10,"['Aarhus Universitet', 'Gødstrup Hospital']",Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Gender', 'PTSD and Mental Health Treatment', 'Torture and Rehabilitation']",,"The article investigates the prevalence and demographic associations of reported torture exposure and its connection to PTSD among recently arrived refugees in Aarhus, Denmark. This study is part of a broader context of global human rights challenges, where torture continues despite international prohibitions, affecting refugees both in their home countries and during their flight to safety.

1. **Context**: Torture remains a pervasive issue worldwide, with many countries involved in its practice. Refugees fleeing from such environments often arrive in host countries with physical and mental trauma, highlighting the need for effective health interventions.

2. **Purpose**: The research seeks to understand the prevalence of torture among refugees in Denmark and the demographic characteristics related to torture exposure. It also examines the correlation between torture and PTSD, aiming to inform better refugee health care practices.

3. **Methods**: The study utilizes data from general health assessments of adult refugees in Aarhus from 2017-2019. Chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests were used to analyze associations between demographics and torture exposure, with a focus on PTSD.

4. **Findings**: The study found that 13.9% of the refugee sample reported torture exposure, with a significant correlation between torture and PTSD. Male refugees were more likely to report torture. The highest torture prevalence was among refugees from Iran, Syria, and Afghanistan. The study also uncovered that healthcare providers often fail to recognize torture and its health implications.

5. **Legal Frameworks**: Denmark, as a signatory to the UN Convention against Torture, is committed to assessing and rehabilitating torture victims. Recognizing torture victims is crucial for granting them legal rights and support under international law.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The study underscores the need for better health screening and early intervention for torture victims, particularly in addressing PTSD. It recommends implementing comprehensive rehabilitation programs and tailoring support systems for vulnerable groups. Policymakers and healthcare providers must collaborate to improve care for this population.

7. **Limitations**: The study faced challenges such as the sensitivity of torture-related questions, potential underreporting due to stigma, and the retrospective nature of data collection. The political context in the refugees' home countries may affect the results, and the cross-sectional design limits causal inferences.

Overall, the study highlights the critical need to address torture-related health issues in refugee populations and informs better healthcare and policy interventions. Further research is needed to explore the prevalence and demographic associations of torture in more detail.","Torture victims live with complex health conditions. It is essential for the rehabilitation of torture survivors that their traumas are recognized at an early stage. The aim of this study was to investigate (i) the prevalence of reported torture exposure, (ii) the association between demographic characteristics and exposure to torture, and (iii) the association between PTSD and exposure to torture among recently arrived refugees in Aarhus, Denmark. Data were extracted from health assessments of refugees arriving in Aarhus in the years 2017–2019, and 208 cases were included in the analysis. The prevalence of reported torture was 13.9% (29/208). Most torture victims were found among refugees arriving from Iran (17.0% (9/53)), Syria (9.3% (8/86)), and Afghanistan (25.0% (5/20)). Significant associations were found between reported torture exposure and male gender, Southeast Asian origin, and a diagnosis of PTSD. In the study, 24.5% (24/98) of males and 4.5% (5/110) of females had been subjected to torture. However, it is possible that the prevalence of female torture survivors is underestimated due to the taboos surrounding sexual assaults and fear of stigmatization. Nearly half of the torture victims in the study were diagnosed with PTSD (44.8% (13/29)). The results confirm that torture victims constitute a vulnerable group living with severe consequences, including mental illness such as PTSD. Furthermore, understanding the cultural perspectives of the distress among refugees is crucial in providing appropriate healthcare services. This study highlights the importance of addressing the mental health needs of torture survivors and tailoring interventions toward vulnerable refugee populations."
Simultaneous molecular detection of Anaplasma marginale and Theileria annulata in cattle blood samples collected from Pakistan-Afghanistan boarder region,"Sania Jamil, Chien-Chun Chiou, Hira Muqaddas, Hayat Ullah, Muhammad Asif, Sana Rao, Hafsa Hussain, Qandeel Fatima, Nasreen Nasreen, Sadaf Niaz, Karla Dzul-Rosado, Adil Khan, Furhan Iqbal, Chien-Chin Chen",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0288050,2023-7-20,['Bahauddin Zakariya University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Economy and Infrastructure', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Agriculture', 'Disease Prevention']",,"The article provides an analysis of the prevalence of two significant tick-borne pathogens, *Theileria annulata* and *Anaplasma marginale*, in cattle from the Bajaur district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Pakistan.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: 
   Bajaur, located on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, is a mountainous area where livestock is a primary source of income. The region's climate is conducive to tick populations, influencing the prevalence of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) that cause economic challenges in Pakistan's agrarian economy.

2. **Purpose of Research and Human Rights Challenges**: 
   The research aims to fill a gap in data concerning the prevalence of these pathogens in northwestern Pakistan, which suffers from inadequate control measures against TBDs. While not explicitly addressing human rights, the research supports socio-economic rights by seeking to improve livestock health and economic stability in rural communities.

3. **Research Methods**: 
   The study collected 298 blood samples from three cattle breeds and used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of *T. annulata* and *A. marginale*. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to understand genetic relations, and statistical methods assessed prevalence differences across breeds and locations.

4. **Main Findings**: 
   The prevalence of *T. annulata* (10.4%) was higher than that of *A. marginale* (5.4%). While *T. annulata* prevalence varied significantly by location, no such variation was found for *A. marginale*. The study highlighted that traditional rural management practices increase susceptibility to these infections.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: 
   While the article does not specifically examine legal frameworks, it underscores the need for effective tick control and livestock management policies to mitigate economic losses.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: 
   The study concludes that both pathogens are endemic in Bajaur and recommends large-scale studies throughout Pakistan to better inform tick control strategies, thereby benefiting the livestock industry and the national economy.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: 
   The study faced limitations due to a lack of prior data from the region, potential biases from small sample sizes, and the political climate, which might hinder comprehensive data collection and analysis. Moreover, the sensitivity of economic impacts tied to livestock health remains a challenge in implementing broader control measures.

In summation, the research identifies critical epidemiological concerns and calls for enhanced control measures to improve the livestock sector's productivity and the livelihood of rural communities in Pakistan.","Theileria annulata (T. annulata) and Anaplasma marginale (A. marginale) are among the most extensively reported tick borne pathogens and are associated with huge economic losses worldwide. A total of 298 cattle blood samples were screened to report the presence of these two pathogens. The samples were collected from apparently healthy cattle (Achai, n = 155, Jersy, n = 88 and crossbred, n = 55) in Bajaur district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) during June and July of 2022. A total of 31 out of 298 cattle (10.4%) were found infected with T. annulata as PCR amplified a 156 base pair fragment from Tams-1 gene of T. annulata from their blood. While 16/298 animals (5.4%) were found infected with A. marginale as they amplified a 382 base pair fragment specific for msp5 gene of this bacterium. Three animals (1%) were found co infected. Cattle susceptibility to T. annulata infection was significantly higher than A. marginale infection (P &lt; 0.001). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Pakistani isolates of both detected pathogen clustered together and were closely related isolates from worldwide countries. Prevalence of T. annulata varied significantly among the sampling sites (P = 0.05) while no such association was observed for A. marginale among the tested cattle. Epidemiological data analysis revealed that none of the studied risk factors was found associated either with the prevalence of T. annulata or A. marginale (P &gt; 0.05) among enrolled cattle. In conclusion, our study has revealed a relatively higher prevalence of T. annulata than A. marginale in cattle from the Bajaur district in KPK. This information is important for improving the productivity of the livestock sector, which is one of the main sources of income in the country. It is recommended that this data be taken into account for the development and implementation of effective tick control programs, as well as for the improvement of livestock management practices to prevent and manage TBDs in Pakistan."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The study focuses on minor refugees in Germany, a social group affected by forced migration and political complexities. Particularly, the study distinguishes between Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) and Accompanied Refugee Minors (ARM), reflecting the diverse backgrounds and challenges this population faces in a new country.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions:**
   The research aims to explore the prevalence and influencing factors of depression and mental distress among minor refugees in Germany. It specifically addresses human rights challenges related to mental health and well-being, emphasizing the vulnerability of URM compared to ARM.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study utilizes a cross-sectional design with a large and representative sample of minor refugees. It involves a newly developed questionnaire (MEHIRA-SQ) grounded in systematic literature review findings to assess various factors associated with mental distress.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - URMs exhibit significantly higher prevalence rates of depression and mental distress than ARMs.
   - Key factors increasing mental distress include the number of stressful life events, female gender, and fear of deportation.
   - Protective factors include regular family contact, school attendance, and proficiency in the German language.
   - The study did not find significant associations with factors like length of time in Germany, origin country, age, or religious importance.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   Although the study does not explicitly examine Germany's legal frameworks, it indirectly highlights gaps in policies regarding refugee minors' mental health and integration processes.

6. **Authors’ Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that URMs are a high-risk subgroup within minor refugees and emphasize the importance of differentiating between URM and ARM in research to address heterogeneity in mental health prevalence. They recommend culturally sensitive interventions, increased school involvement, family contact, and language skill development as crucial support measures. They also suggest further validation through longitudinal studies.

7. **Limitations:**
   The study acknowledges several limitations, including the heterogeneous response format of the questionnaire, reliance on self-rated screening, and potential recruitment bias toward psychologically distressed participants. Moreover, its cross-sectional nature limits causal interpretations, necessitating cautious interpretation and further longitudinal validation. The political climate and data sensitivity concerning refugee mental health may have also influenced the outcomes.","AbstractPrevalences for mental disorders within minor refugees are comparatively high and heterogeneous. To reduce heterogeneity and identify high-risk subgroups, we compared unaccompanied refugee minors (URM) to accompanied refugee minors (ARM) regarding depressive symptoms and mental distress. Furthermore, we examined associative factors of mental distress in URM on a broad scale. We conducted a survey with a cross-sectional design in four German University hospitals. The sample consisted of n = 172 URM and n = 52 ARM aged 14–21. Depressive symptoms were assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Mental distress was assessed by the Refugee Health Screener (RHS-15). Mann–Whitney test was used to examine differences between URM and ARM. Associated factors of mental distress were evaluated via a stepwise multiple regression analysis. URM showed significantly higher mean scores for PHQ-9 (p &lt; .001) and RHS-15 (p &lt; .001) compared to ARM indicating medium effect sizes. Furthermore, URM were significantly more likely to surpass the cut-off for depression (61.6% vs. 30.8%) and overall mental distress (81.4% vs. 53.8%) compared to ARM. The factors Number of stressful life events (SLE), Female gender, and Fear of deportation were found to be associated with an increased mental distress in URM, whereas Weekly contact to a family member, School attendance, and German language skills were accompanied with lower distress scores. All six factors accounted for 32% of the variance of mental distress in URM (p &lt; .001). Within minor refugees, URM are a highly vulnerable subgroup, which should receive particular attention and more targeted measures by health authorities. Our results indicate that these measures should comprise a rapid promotion of family contact, school attendance, language acquisition, and the fast processing of asylum applications. However, the cross-sectional design limits the interpretability of the results."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Afghanistan has faced a tumultuous history, especially concerning women's rights, with significant regression during the Taliban rule. The return of the Taliban has raised concerns about the potential rollback of women's rights and human rights more broadly, informed by past experiences under Taliban governance where women faced severe restrictions and violence.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research aims to examine the types and impacts of violence experienced by Afghan women and girls, particularly focusing on the changes and challenges brought by the return of the Taliban. It addresses fundamental human rights questions, particularly regarding gender-based violence and the suppression of women's rights.

3. **Research Methods Used**: Although specifics are not detailed in this summary request, typical methods for such studies might include qualitative analyses of personal narratives, legal documents, and possibly interviews with stakeholders.

4. **Main Findings**: The study likely highlights severe human rights violations against women, including restrictions on education, employment, and personal freedoms. It may identify trends of increasing gender-based violence and the institutional and societal barriers to addressing these issues.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The article likely critiques Afghanistan's legal frameworks, showing how they fail to protect women under Taliban rule. It might discuss the role of international agreements like CEDAW and their implementation challenges in Afghanistan.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors might conclude with a call for international intervention and sustained pressure on the Taliban to uphold women's rights. Recommendations could include strengthening legal protections, increasing educational opportunities for women, and leveraging international human rights instruments to enforce accountability.

7. **Study Limitations**: The research likely notes limitations such as data availability, the political climate under Taliban rule making research dangerous or difficult, and the broader instability affecting consistent human rights monitoring.

However, the specifics for items 3, 4, 5, and 6 are inferred and would need direct information from the article for exact details.","Serious concerns on the rights of Afghanistan’s women and girls have been raised ever since the Taliban returned to power on 15th August   2021. This paper uses a normative methodology to investigate the discrepancy of legal argument in the international law of succession in terms of status of Taliban within the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) framework. This paper confirmed that the Taliban is the de facto government of Afghanistan as the Taliban have effective and integrated control over a state territory and there is no competing entity with a solid constitutional claim. Therefore, the Taliban is bound by international law to guarantee that women enjoy equal educational rights, including access to school and curriculum.  However, the current framework of CEDAW, including the CEDAW committee has not be able to cope with such issues, as it should be reformed in the next future."

Adolescent Pregnancy in South Asia: A Pooled Analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys,"Samikshya Poudel, Timothy Dobbins, Husna Razee, Blessing Akombi-Inyang",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20126099,2023-6-10,['UNSW Sydney'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Education']","['Maternal Health', 'Gender', 'Civil Liberties']",,"**Overview**: The article addresses the high rates of adolescent pregnancy in South Asia, providing historical context of the region's socio-economic and cultural factors that influence early pregnancies. South Asia reports the second-highest rate of adolescent pregnancy globally, largely due to early marriage customs and socio-economic conditions.

**Purpose of Research**: The study aims to identify factors associated with adolescent pregnancy across six South Asian countries using Demographic and Health Survey data. It seeks to bridge the knowledge gap in the region and assist in creating effective socio-cultural interventions to prevent adolescent pregnancy.

**Research Methods**: This is a secondary data analysis using survey data from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal, India, the Maldives, and Bangladesh. A four-stage modified WHO framework was employed, involving univariate and multivariable logistic regressions to assess various socio-economic and behavioral factors.

**Main Findings**: Key factors linked to adolescent pregnancy include low household wealth, male-headed households, increased age, and poor exposure to family planning information. Afghanistan had the highest adolescent pregnancy rate, while the Maldives had the lowest. Factors contributing to high pregnancy rates include socio-cultural beliefs, lack of education, and early sexual debut, while lower rates were associated with higher literacy and socio-economic development.

**Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The study briefly touches on the varying legal ages of marriage across these countries, which influence adolescent pregnancy rates.

**Conclusions and Recommendations**: The study recommends culturally sensitive interventions, such as comprehensive sexuality education, particularly in resource-poor settings. It emphasizes the importance of mass media in spreading awareness and suggests improving access to contraceptives to reduce early pregnancies.

**Limitations**: The study's cross-sectional nature limits causal interpretations. It only includes ever-married adolescents, potentially introducing selection bias. The exclusion of Sri Lanka and Bhutan limits the generalizability to all South Asian countries. Additionally, the study lacks data on certain influences like religion, pregnancy desire, and social media exposure. Future research incorporating these factors could provide further insights.","Adolescent pregnancy has important health and social implications. Despite the availability of nationally representative household survey data, there are limited studies that analyze factors associated with adolescent pregnancy across countries of South Asia. This study aimed to identify factors associated with adolescent pregnancy across South Asia. This study used the most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from six countries in South Asia: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan. Pooled individual record data from 20,828 ever-married women aged 15–19 years were used for the analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis, informed by the World Health Organization framework on social determinants of health, was performed to examine factors associated with adolescent pregnancy. Adolescent pregnancy was highest in Afghanistan compared to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, India, and the Maldives. Multivariable analyses confirmed that being from a poor household or male-headed household, increasing maternal age, having no access to newspapers, and having no knowledge of family planning were significantly associated with adolescent pregnancy. The use or intention to use contraceptives was protective against adolescent pregnancy. To reduce adolescent pregnancy in South Asia, interventions targeting adolescents from poor households with limited access to mass media should be considered, especially those from households with an existing patriarchal structure."

Head",https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.1357,2023-6-22,['Dow Medical College Pakistan'],Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"AbstractBackground and AimsSouth Asian countries, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, and Bangladesh, have a high prevalence of pulmonary and extra‐pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB). This prevalence is influenced by various risk factors such as ethnicity, nutrition, socioeconomic disparities, high out‐of‐pocket healthcare expenses, and specific Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (TB) lineages. The COVID‐19 pandemic has likely hindered access to healthcare and led to under‐reporting of EPTB cases nationally and internationally. This rapid review aimed to summarize the literature on the prevalence and disease outcomes of EPTB in the mentioned countries, compare the situations across countries, and provide recommendations for future action.MethodsThe review utilized PubMed and Google Scholar databases to search for literature on EPTB in South Asian countries. The search string included keywords related to different forms of EPTB and the countries of interest while excluding pulmonary tuberculosis.ResultsThe results showed that both TB, including drug‐resistant TB, and EPTB are prevalent and burdensome in South Asia. In Pakistan, pleural TB was the most commonly reported form of EPTB, followed by lymph node TB, abdominal TB, osteoarticular TB, Central Nervous System TB, and miliary TB. In India, lymph node TB(LNTB) was more common among EPTB cases. Bangladesh reported a high prevalence of EPTB involving lymph node, pleura, and abdomen, while Afghanistan had a higher prevalence of forms such as LNTB and tuberculous meningitis.ConclusionIn conclusion, the prevalence of EPTB in Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, and Bangladesh is alarmingly high and negatively impacts population health. Effective measures are needed for treatment and management of this condition, along with addressing current and future challenges. Strengthening the evidence base through surveillance and research is crucial to understand the patterns and significant factors related to EPTB, requiring investment in these areas."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   - Germany has seen a decreasing incidence of tuberculosis (TB) amongst its native population while a significant number of cases occur in patients born outside the country. This study reflects a broader European trend where TB manifestations differ based on geographic origin.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   - The study aims to explore how geographical origins influence clinical manifestations of TB, specifically addressing the occurrence of isolated extrapulmonary TB among patients from certain regions. It considers the broader human rights implication of equitable access to healthcare and early diagnosis for migrant populations.

3. **Research Methods:**
   - The study analyzed TB cases at a German tertiary care center, identifying the geographical origins and correlating these with TB manifestations. It focused on patients from specific WHO regions and seven countries, investigating factors like age, comorbidities, and living conditions.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - Isolated extrapulmonary TB is more frequent among patients from India, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, and Turkey. Younger patients from these countries exhibit fewer comorbidities. The study suggests these differences may result from delayed diagnoses, travel constraints, and socioeconomic factors.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   - While the study does not deeply delve into Germany's legal frameworks, it implies a need for policies ensuring prompt TB diagnosis and care for migrants, highlighting disparities in health outcomes based on the origin that might require policy attention.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - Geographic origin is a predictor of TB manifestation. Future research should explore immune system responses, bacterial virulence, and healthcare access disparities to understand TB's varied clinical presentations successfully.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   - The study is monocentric with no bacterial typing or genetic data correlation. Despite a significant sample size for a single center, a larger population would strengthen the findings. Political sensitivities and migrant data limitations could also influence study outcomes.","Abstract
                Introduction
                Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by M. tuberculosis complex (MTB) and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is its classical manifestation. However, in some regions of the world, extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) seems to be more frequent.
              
                Methods
                We performed a retrospective cohort study of all TB patients treated at University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany, for the time period 2013–2018. Patient charts were reviewed and demographic, clinical, and microbiological data recorded. Patients were subdivided according to their geographic origins.
              
                Results
                Of the 378 included patients, 309 were born outside Germany (81.7%). Three WHO regions were significantly associated with the occurrence of isolated EPTB: the South-East Asian Region (OR 3.37, CI 1.74–6.66, p &lt; 0.001), the African Region (2.20, CI 1.25–3.90, p = 0.006), and the Eastern Mediterranean Region (OR 3.18, CI 1.78–5.76, p &lt; 0.001). On a country level, seven countries of origin could be demonstrated to be significantly associated with the occurrence of isolated EPTB: India (OR 5.58, CI 2.30–14.20, p &lt; 0.001), Nepal (OR 12.75, CI 1.73–259.28, p = 0.027), Afghanistan (OR 3.64, CI 1.14–11.98, p = 0.029), Pakistan (OR 3.64, CI 1.14–11.98, p = 0.029), Eritrea (OR 3.32, CI 1.52–7.47, p = 0.003), Somalia (OR 7.08, CI 2.77–19.43, p &lt; 0.001), and Turkey (OR 9.56, CI 2.52–47.19, p = 0.002).
              
                Conclusion
                Geographical origin is a predictor for the occurrence of extrapulmonary TB. This might be linked to a delay in diagnosis in these patients, as well as specific responsible impairments of the host’s immune system, possible virulence factors of MTB, and relevant comorbidities.

Post-regime-change Afghan and Iraqi media systems: Strategic ambivalence as technology of media governance,Mohammed A Salih,https://doi.org/10.1177/17506352211062749,2021-12-30,['University of Pennsylvania'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available," This article investigates the governance of post-US invasion Afghan and Iraqi media systems by analyzing provisions pertinent to public broadcasting, licensing, and defamation in 14 laws and policy documents in the two nations. The author argues that the results point to a regime of regulatory ambivalence whereby state authorities have established an ontologically incongruent complex of legal and policy structures characterized by a simultaneous cohabitation of democratic and authoritarian tendencies. This ambivalence, born of struggles and contestations between state authorities, domestic civil societies and external supporters and donors, is a deliberate technology of media governance. The authoritarian tendencies of this regulatory regime have implications for media/journalists’ self-regulation as they are designed to curtail the agency of media institutions and journalists, and assert government control over speech and the flow of information.

Duncombe, Albane Girma, Caroline Mitchell",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-021-01622-x,2021-7-27,"['The Sheffield Medical School', 'MSF']",Article,1,Yes,"['Humanitarian and Development Assistance', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Gender', 'Nutrition', 'Disease Prevention']",,"### Summary of the Article

1. **Historical and Contextual Overview**
   - The study examines conditions within the Samos reception centre for asylum seekers, situated within a broader context of ongoing challenges faced by migrants and refugees coming to Europe, particularly Greece. Historical pressures include waves of migration due to conflicts and persecution, with Greek reception centres often being overburdened.

2. **Purpose of the Research**
   - The research aims to highlight human rights challenges related to basic living conditions, safety, and health affecting asylum seekers, particularly focusing on deficiencies in housing, nutrition, sanitation, and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV).

3. **Research Methods**
   - A novel survey methodology was employed, emphasizing asylum seekers' priorities and international standards. Data was collected through anonymized self-reported questionnaires focusing on living conditions and health challenges within the camp.

4. **Main Findings**
   - **Safety and Living Conditions**: The camp's infrastructure is inadequate, with issues like overcrowded, poorly lit sanitary facilities leading to increased physical violence and heightened SGBV risk, particularly for single women.
   - **Health Vulnerabilities**: Residents face heightened prevalence of respiratory, diarrhoeal, and dermatological diseases due to poor hygiene, malnutrition, and lack of clean water. The absence of cooking facilities further exacerbates food insecurity and poor health outcomes.
   - **SGBV Concerns**: There is a significant prevalence of SGBV, notably among single women and individuals from specific national backgrounds, highlighting the need for better protection measures.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**
   - While the study highlights deficiencies in meeting asylum seekers' needs, it implicitly critiques Greek authorities' inability to provide adequate resources and legal protections in the camp.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**
   - The study calls for immediate improvements in camp conditions, multidisciplinary healthcare, and psychosocial support. It suggests further research directed by camp residents to better address their needs and advocates for expedited processing of asylum applications to reduce pressure on resources.

7. **Study Limitations**
   - Methodological limitations include response bias inherent in self-reported data, potential impacts of interpreter presence during questioning, and sampling bias from recruiting at a clinic, potentially omitting certain demographics. The political climate may also affect transparency and the ability to gather comprehensive data on sensitive topics like SGBV.

Overall, the article underscores urgent human rights challenges in the Samos reception centre, recommending targeted improvements in living and health conditions while advocating for policies that strengthen asylum seekers' protection and support systems.","Abstract
                Background
                In 2019, a migrant camp on the Greek island of Samos designed for 650 people was home to a growing population of over 5500. We aimed to quantitatively describe living conditions and health needs in the camp.
              
                Methods
                A questionnaire was designed with reference to international humanitarian standards, following a consultative process with the asylum-seeker population. Domains assessed included demographics, living conditions, safety/vulnerability, and health. The questionnaire was piloted and then conducted in June 2019 on a sample of asylum seekers.
              
                Results
                Five hundred participants, predominantly from Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Of these, 79.4% lived in tents. Respondents cared for a total of 570 children; 20.6% of women were pregnant, 35.4% had experienced violence, 83% psychological distress, 71% skin disease, 66% diarrhoea and vomiting, and 64% respiratory disease. Accommodation, sanitation, and nutrition fell below internationally recognised standards, and poor access to water was significantly associated (p &lt; 0.001) with respiratory disease, diarrhoea and vomiting, skin disease ,and psychological distress.
              
                Conclusions
                Living conditions in the Samos camp fall below basic humanitarian standards and are associated with poor health status. Further research is imperative to analyse and monitor the diverse, varying needs of asylum-seekers and inform policies to improve conditions.

Parenting app to support socio-emotional and cognitive development in early childhood: Iterative codesign learnings from nine low-income and middle-income countries,"Mafruha Alam, Ian B Hickie, Adam Poulsen, Mahalakshmi Ekambareshwar, Victoria Loblay, Jacob Crouse, Gabrielle Hindmarsh, Yun J C Song, Adam Yoon, Grace Cha, Chloe Wilson, Madelaine Sweeney-Nash, Jakelin Troy, Haley M LaMonica",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-071232,2023-5-16,['The University of Sydney'],Article,1,Yes,"['Education', 'Technology']","['Literacy Programs', 'Digital Technology']",,"1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: 
   The article discusses the need for improved early child development (ECD) interventions in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), where a significant percentage of children under five are not reaching essential developmental milestones. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4.2 addresses this issue by aiming to enhance the development of children under five. The increased access to mobile technology worldwide presents an opportunity to use digital tools for promoting ECD, particularly in areas with limited access to traditional educational resources.

2. **Purpose of the Research**:
   The study aimed to develop a culturally relevant early child development app, targeting low-income and middle-income countries in Asia and Africa. It addresses the challenge of improving awareness and practices among parents and caregivers regarding nurturing care to support children's cognitive, emotional, and social development despite socio-economic barriers.

3. **Research Methods**:
   The research employed an iterative codesign process, integrating feedback from end-users (parents and caregivers) and local experts. The approach emphasized participation in content development, involving idea generation, prototyping, and ongoing feedback to ensure cultural relevance and usability.

4. **Main Findings**:
   The research highlighted the effectiveness of using digital technologies to educate and empower caregivers in LMICs about early childhood development. The app was found to be accessible and effective when it included culturally tailored content, addressed linguistic diversity, and offered various delivery modes suitable for different literacy levels. The content covered key neurobiological systems relevant to child development under five domains: Cognitive Brain, Social Brain, Language and Communication, Identity and Culture, and Physical Health.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**:
   While the study itself did not focus directly on legal frameworks, it aligned with international developmental goals like the UN's SDGs, emphasizing the relevance of legal and institutional support for initiatives enhancing child development.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**:
   The authors concluded that collaborative, culturally contextualized digital tools can significantly enhance early childhood development by providing accessible resources to caregivers. They recommended ongoing stakeholder engagement to refine content further and called for partnerships with local organizations to improve implementation.

7. **Study Limitations**:
   Limitations included potential political or socio-economic constraints within targeted countries, affecting the adoption of digital tools. Additionally, data availability and sensitivities around human rights and child development practices could impact the study's outcomes and applicability.","ObjectiveMany children in low-income and middle-income countries are disadvantaged in achieving early developmental potential in childhood as they lack the necessary support from their surroundings, including from parents and caregivers. Digital technologies, such as smartphone apps, coupled with iterative codesign to engage end-users in the technology-delivered content development stages, can help overcome gaps in early child development (ECD). We describe the iterative codesign and quality improvement process that informs the development of content for theThrive by Five International Program, localised for nine countries in Asia and Africa.DesignBetween 2021 and 2022, an average of six codesign workshops in each country were conducted in Afghanistan, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya and Namibia.ParticipantsA total of 174 parents and caregivers and 58 in-country subject matter experts participated and provided feedback to refine and inform the cultural appropriateness of theThrive by Fiveapp and its content. Detailed notes from the workshops and written feedback were coded and analysed using established thematic techniques.ResultsFour themes emerged from the codesign workshops: local realities, barriers to positive parenting, child development and lessons learnt about the cultural context. These themes, as well as various subthemes, informed content development and refinement. For example, childrearing activities were requested and developed to promote inclusion of families from diverse backgrounds, encourage best parenting practices, increase engagement of fathers in ECD, address parents’ mental well-being, educate children about cultural values and help bereaved children with grief and loss. Also, content that did not align with the laws or culture of any country were removed.ConclusionsThe iterative codesign process informed the development of a culturally relevant app for parents and caregivers of children in the early years. Further evaluation is required to assess user experience and impact in real world settings."

Health-related quality of life in persons with haemophilia in Afghanistan,"Sayed Mohammad Reza Hosseini, Sayed Hamid Mousavi, Seyed Alireza Mesbah‐Namin, Shadi Tabibian, Akbar Dorgalaleh",https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.14772,2023-3-3,['Kateb Univesity'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"AbstractIntroductionHaemophilia is the most common severe congenital bleeding disorder and can significantly influence patients’ quality of life. The health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) is a multi‐dimensional concept that assess effect of different aspects of health status, including physical, mental, and social domains. Identification of the factors affecting the HRQoL of Persons with Haemophilia (PWH) can guide health care system to better management of patients.AimThe aim of the present study is to evaluate HRQoL in PWH in Afghanistan.MethodsThis cross‐sectional study was conducted on 100 PWH in Kabul City, Afghanistan. Data were collected using 36‐Item‐Short‐Form Health Survey (SF‐36) questionnaire and analysed using correlation coefficients and regression analysis.ResultsThe mean scores for the SF‐36 questionnaire 8 domains range from 33 ± 38.3 to 58.15 ± 20.5. The highest mean value belongs to physical function (PF) (58.15), whereas the lowest is related to restriction of activities due to emotional problems (RE) (33.00). A significant association (p &lt; .005) was observed between all domains of SF‐36 and patients’ age except for PF (p = .055) and general health (GH) (p = .75). A significant association was also observed between all HRQoL domains and the severity of haemophilia (p &lt; .001). The severity of haemophilia was the significant predictor for Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) (p &lt; .001).ConclusionDue to the reduced HRQoL in Afghan PWH, special attention by health care system should be paid to improve patients’ quality of life."
Global polio eradication; can we replicate the smallpox success story?,"Haseeba Javed, Musa Ali Rizvi, Zara Fahim, Muhammad Ehsan, Mubeena Javed, Muhammad Asad Raza",https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2409,2022-11-25,['King Edward Medical University Lahore'],Editorial,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"AbstractAlthough the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been largely successful in elimination of polio from various parts of the world, sporadic local outbreaks in non‐endemic areas continue to pose a threat to global polio eradication efforts. In the two endemic countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan, a staggering 176 cases of wild poliovirus 1 (WPV1) were reported in 2019. In 2020 alone, 959 cases of Circulating Vaccine Derived Poliovirus 2 were reported globally from 27 countries. After staying polio‐free for years, cases of WPV were detected in Malawi and Mozambique in 2022. The roots of the reported strains matched with the WPV strain from Pakistan. The emergence of WPV cases in Malawi and Mozambique underscores the fact that WPV still has the chance to spread beyond the Afghanistan‐Pakistan region and sustained efforts are required for its complete eradication. In the case of smallpox, surveillance‐containment was the key to eradication as many countries had already eradicated smallpox and the bigger concern was to track and contain any new cases emerging. Smallpox eradication followed a comprehensive plan which included elements like quality control and standardisation of vaccination protocols. Governments all over the world should prioritise immunisation drives, surveillance, and awareness campaigns to achieve the dream of a polio‐free world."
Negative and protective experiences influencing the well-being of refugee children resettling in Germany: A qualitative study,"Shaymaa Abdelhamid, Jutta Lindert, Joachim Fischer, Maria Steinisch",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-067332,2023-4-19,['Medizinische Fakultät Mannheim'],Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Migration', 'Disease Prevention']",,"The article provides a detailed analysis of the experiences of refugee children in Germany and focuses on understanding the adversities and protective factors that influence their well-being. Here is a summary based on the requested points:

1. **Context**: In 2018, Germany hosted a significant proportion of refugees, with many fleeing conflict zones such as Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The socio-political environment for refugees involves complex challenges across the stages of migration: pre-flight, flight, and post-flight, each contributing to the refugees' psychological well-being.

2. **Purpose**: The research aims to illuminate the adversities and protective experiences of refugee children from the perspective of both children and their parents. It addresses human rights concerns related to children's health, well-being, and access to a safe, nurturing environment.

3. **Methods**: The study employed qualitative semi-structured interviews conducted with refugee children and parents in Germany. The selection of participants ensured representation from the larger refugee-seeking population. Data were managed using MAXQDA software, and a reflexive thematic analysis was conducted through Braun and Clarke's method.

4. **Findings**: The study identified six negative themes, such as disruptions to daily life, exposure to violence, and feelings of isolation or rejection. Additionally, two protective themes emerged: feeling secure/stable and maintaining connections. The findings underscore the significant psychological impact that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have on refugee children.

5. **Legal Frameworks**: The study indirectly touches on Germany's policies by noting refugee experiences related to family reunification processes and societal integration challenges.

6. **Conclusions & Recommendations**: The authors emphasize the need for comprehensive support systems for refugee children focusing on resilience and empowerment through secure environments and community support. They recommend policies to facilitate stability and protection at community and societal levels.

7. **Limitations**: The study acknowledges potential issues with language interpretation, which might have led to under-translation or misinterpretation of participants' responses. The political climate and data collection challenges (e.g., lack of identifiable, continuous contact with participants) represent further limitations.

Overall, the study highlights the complex socio-ecological factors influencing refugee children's lives and underscores the importance of addressing these in policy and practice to safeguard their human rights and development.","ObjectiveConflict, forced migration and searching for safety in a foreign land are all experiences common to refugee children. They experience potentially traumatic events that are distinct from the general population, yet current adverse childhood experience (ACE) studies do not cover these events. Studies that do examine refugee children’s experiences typically focus on a single stage of migration or adversities from the community, offering insight into only a fraction of their realities. This study aimed to identify potentially traumatising and protective experiences subjectively perceived as influencing refugee children’s well-being from all stages of migration and all socio-ecological levels.DesignQualitative study with thematic analysis of semi-structured individual and group interviews. Themes were organised within a socio-ecological model.SettingNon-profit organisations, youth welfare facilities and societies that organise civic engagement for refugee families in the Rhine-Neckar region in Germany provided rooms where interviews could be conducted.ParticipantsRefugee parents and children who spoke one of the four most common languages of those seeking asylum in Germany in 2018 were included. This study excluded refugees who were not fleeing a conflict area. Forty-seven refugee parents and 11 children (aged 8–17 years) from Syria, Iraq, Palestine, Afghanistan and Eritrea participated.ResultsEight major themes emerged from interviews including six reflecting potentially negative experiences and two potentially protective themes. These themes evolved from experiences such as family dispersion, displacement, rigorous immigration and national policies, as well as constructive parenting and community support.ConclusionIt is increasingly important to identify these diverse experiences as the refugee population continues to grow, and the increased prevalence of poor health outcomes in refugee children continues to be widely documented. Identifying ACEs specifically relevant to refugee children could contribute to understanding potential pathways and could further serve as a starting point for tailored interventions."

Basic life support knowledge among healthcare providers in Afghanistan: a cross-sectional study of current competencies and areas for improvement,"Arash Nemat, Mohammad Hamid Nedaie, Mohammad Yasir Essar, Henry Ashworth, Hasibullah Aminpoor, Abdul Wahed Sediqi, Wafaa Binti Mowlabaccus, Shoaib Ahmad",https://doi.org/10.1097/MS9.0000000000000273,2023-4,"['Kabul University', 'Karolinska Institutet', 'Ariana Medical Complex']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Education']","['Disease Prevention', 'Public Health Education']",,"The article addresses the urgent need for improving Basic Life Support (BLS) knowledge among healthcare workers in Afghanistan, a country grappling with high rates of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and ongoing conflicts. Historically, Afghanistan's political unrest and healthcare challenges have exacerbated morbidity and mortality rates, necessitating enhanced emergency care proficiency among medical professionals.

1. **Context**: Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death in Afghanistan, exacerbated by sociopolitical instability and conflict. The ability to deliver Basic Life Support (BLS), especially Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), is vital yet understudied among Afghan healthcare workers.

2. **Purpose**: This study aimed to assess BLS knowledge and practices among healthcare workers in Kabul, focusing on identifying gaps in emergency medical skills essential for improving patient outcomes in a conflict-ridden, low-resource setting.

3. **Methods**: The study used a cross-sectional design with convenience sampling across various hospitals in Kabul. Participants were regular healthcare workers who completed a questionnaire based on the AHA 2019 BLS Guidelines. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and χ2-tests to examine associations between demographics and BLS knowledge levels.

4. **Findings**: A significant lack of BLS knowledge was identified—95.3% of participants scored poorly with only a minor portion, specifically doctors, showing good knowledge and practice of BLS standards. Recognition of CPR was high, yet specifics like correct compression techniques were poorly understood.

5. **Legal Frameworks, Institutions, Policies**: The study underscores an urgent need for robust health education policies and training programs to equip Afghan healthcare workers with essential BLS skills, though no current frameworks directly address this need.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: Authors stress the importance of integrating regular BLS training and re-certification in Afghanistan's medical curriculum. They recommend policy makers prioritize the establishment of comprehensive training programs to enhance both awareness and technical skills in BLS among healthcare professionals.

7. **Limitations**: The study's scope was limited geographically to Kabul, potentially underrepresenting rural knowledge deficits. It focused on self-reported survey data without practical assessments, and the political situation may restrict broader national survey and training efforts.

This research presents a critical call to action for enhancing emergency medical education in Afghanistan, advocating for initiatives that could markedly improve care standards and patient survival in emergency situations.","Basic life support (BLS) is a type of emergency care provided by healthcare workers and public safety professionals to individuals experiencing cardiac arrest, respiratory distress, or other cardiopulmonary emergencies. Despite having a high burden of cardiovascular disease and trauma from conflict in Afghanistan, little is known about the level of BLS knowledge Afghani healthcare workers have. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Kabul, Afghanistan, to assess healthcare workers’ training and knowledge of BLS. The study, which took place from March to June 2022 across multiple public and private hospitals, was approved by the institutional ethics committee of Ariana Medical Complex. The sample size was calculated using a nonprobability convenience sampling method, and the study population consisted of healthcare workers actively working in a health center who were willing to complete a questionnaire. The results of the study showed that most participants (71.3%) were in the 21–30-year-old age range, and a third (32.3%) were doctors. 95.3% of participants had poor knowledge of BLS, with a mean score of 4.47±1.58 out of 13. Additionally, it was evident from questionnaire responses that providers are not adequately performing BLS. These findings suggest that further work, including regular BLS courses, is necessary to improve the knowledge and practice of BLS by healthcare workers in Afghanistan."
"Why Parents Sent their Daughters to School: A Qualitative Study of Girls’ Schooling in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan in 2018",Neela Hassan,https://doi.org/10.3366/afg.2023.0102,,[],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available," Afghanistan's history suggests that women's rights are integrally connected to cultural norms and political power. Known as the worst place for women and having the highest level of gender inequality in education, Afghanistan and its people are often portrayed in the Western media as passive and backward individuals with sexist and uncivilized cultural values. This study examines the questions of women's access to education in post-2001 Afghanistan based on the narratives and accounts of schoolgirls and their parents in one of the most insecure provinces of Afghanistan. The study was conducted in the summer of 2018. It draws on 18 semi-structured, in-depth qualitative interviews with schoolgirls and their parents in Kandahar, a southern province of Afghanistan that was the battlefield for the Taliban and American forces for over twenty years. The findings suggest that pragmatic reasons such as security, poverty, and access were the most significant barriers to girls’ education, challenging the traditional assumptions that perceive Afghan cultural values as the only obstacle to girls’ education. I argue that contrary to the stereotypical depiction of Afghanistan and its culture, local actors and cultural values played a vital role in promoting girls’ education. "
Pakistan in 2022: A Year of Crisis and Instability,Mariam Mufti,https://doi.org/10.1525/as.2023.63.2.213,,['University of Waterloo'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"Even by the standards of Pakistan’s historical political instability, 2022 was extremely challenging. The year began with Pakistan on the cusp of sovereign default, with rapidly depleting foreign exchange reserves and skyrocketing inflation. The economic situation was worsened by devastating floods during the monsoon season that directly impacted the lives of 33 million Pakistanis. An energized opposition called for a no-confidence vote against prime minister Imran Khan that in set in motion a chain of political crises that exposed the weakness of political parties, the meddling of the military in politics, and judicial activism. The year ended with Pakistan’s national security being threatened by religious extremist groups operating from Taliban-led Afghanistan."

   The article highlights readiness assessments regarding the adoption and implementation of digital health technologies, revealing gaps such as lack of legislation, infrastructural inadequacies, and healthcare personnel's resistance to change, indicating a need for legal and institutional support for digital health initiatives.

6. **Authors’ Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that digital health tools hold promise for improving healthcare access and quality in MENA's fragile contexts but face challenges such as technological infrastructure, data privacy, and system readiness. They recommend enhancing stakeholder collaboration, legal frameworks, and addressing technological and educational barriers to facilitate effective digital health integration.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The study's limitations include potential biases from data scarcity due to political instability, varied study designs, and reliance on available technological infrastructure, which may not capture the full impact of digital interventions. Additionally, the sensitive nature of healthcare and political climate constraints might affect data reliability and applicability across different regions.

The research underscores the potential and challenges of leveraging digital health tools to address deeply ingrained human rights issues concerning healthcare accessibility in conflict-affected and resource-limited settings.","IntroductionConflict, fragility and political violence, that are taking place in many countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region have devastating effects on health. Digital health technologies can contribute to enhancing the quality, accessibility and availability of health care services in fragile and conflict-affected states of the MENA region. To inform future research, investments and policy processes, this scoping review aims to map out the evidence on digital health in fragile states in the MENA region.MethodWe conducted a scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines. We conducted descriptive analysis of the general characteristics of the included papers and thematic analysis of the key findings of included studies categorized by targeted primary users of different digital health intervention.ResultsOut of the 10,724 articles identified, we included 93 studies. The included studies mainly focused on digital health interventions targeting healthcare providers, clients and data services, while few studies focused on health systems or organizations managers. Most of the included studies were observational studies (49%). We identified no systematic reviews. Most of the studies were conducted in Lebanon (32%) followed by Afghanistan (13%) and Palestine (12%). The first authors were mainly affiliated with institutions from countries outside the MENA region (57%), mainly United Kingdom and United States. Digital health interventions provided a platform for training, supervision, and consultation for health care providers, continuing education for medical students, and disease self-management. The review also highlighted some implementation considerations for the adoption of digital health such as computer literacy, weak technological infrastructure, and privacy concerns.ConclusionThis review showed that digital health technologies can provide promising solutions in addressing health needs in fragile and conflict-affected states. However, rigorous evaluation of digital technologies in fragile settings and humanitarian crises are needed to inform their design and deployment."
Development and psychometric properties of the HBM-based substance abuse prevention questionnaire (HBM-SAPQA) among Afghanian students,"Kanali Mohammadi, Sedigheh Sadat Tavafian, Mahmoud Tavousi",https://doi.org/10.1515/ijamh-2022-0076,2023-2-24,['Tarbiat Modares University'],Review,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"Abstract
               In Afghanistan, adolescents and young people are the most important at risk groups for substance abuse. Considering the importance of model-based interventions in this group, this study aims to design and validate a questionnaire based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) for assessing the beliefs of Afghan students regarding substance abuse prevention behavior. This study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, the items of the questionnaire were designed by conducting a combined documentary literature review and qualitative study. In the next step, its psychometric properties were evaluated through qualitative and quantitative face and content validity (CVR &amp; CVR) and structural validity (exploratory factor analysis). Finally, internal consisitency through Cronbach’s alpha as well as reliability was assessed. To above steps, the SPSS version 18 was applied. 57 items were obtained for the questionnaire by performing a qualitative study and using existing scientific sources for literature review. In checking the face validity of the questionnaire items quantitatively (calculating the impact score), the impact score of all items was above 1.5. The CVR of each item was more than 0.8 and their CVI was more than 0.79. In EFA (using the information of 408 students with average age of 23 years old), the final model was confirmed with 38 related to the main HBM constructs in 5 factors, which covered about 40% of the variance. Acceptable values of Cronbach's alpha between 0.71 and 0.81 for all factors confirmed the reliability of the questionnaire. The HBM-SAPQA obtained the acceptable validity/reliability to apply the beliefs of Afghan students regarding substance abuse preventive behavior."

Here's a summary of the article based on the specified points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**:
   The article discusses Spain's response to the evacuation crisis following the collapse of the Afghan government in 2021. The Spanish government, in coordination with EU and NATO, undertook a comprehensive plan to evacuate Afghan refugees, including those who collaborated with these organizations.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Questions**:
   The piece focuses on the procedures implemented by Spain to receive and temporarily host Afghan refugees, addressing challenges such as health control, identification, and humanitarian assistance, and ensuring the well-being and rights of the evacuees during the transition.

3. **Research Methods Used**:
   The research outlines Spain's multi-ministerial approach, detailing a systematic health control system at points of entry and the collaborative logistics involving various national and international institutions to manage refugee influx and transit.

4. **Main Findings**:
   The operation accommodated up to 2,200 refugees, with health checks and security protocols efficiently conducted at designated facilities. Essential health evaluations, including COVID-19 assessments, were carried out to prevent public health risks and ensure safe transitions to final destinations.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**:
   The article touches on relevant health legislation in force at the time, such as the Spanish Public Health protocols, adjusted to handle the crisis efficiently without compromising national health standards.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**:
   The authors conclude that the coordinated inter-ministerial effort was a success, highlighting the importance of dynamic procedures adaptable to changing circumstances. They recommend continued cooperation among national and regional authorities and making logistical frameworks more resilient for future crises.

7. **Limitations of the Study**:
   Limitations mentioned include potential challenges related to data availability and the dynamic political climate of Afghanistan, which could have impacted the number and condition of refugees. The urgency of the situation also meant certain procedures, such as vaccination, were deferred to the refugees' final destinations.

In summary, the article provides a detailed account of how Spain managed the complex task of receiving Afghan refugees amidst a global health crisis, ensuring their rights and health were adequately safeguarded during the temporary stay in Spain.","Following the announcement of the retreat of troops from Afghanistan, the Spanish Government organised the so-called “Antigone Operation” for the evacuation of Afghan collaborators. The most relevant ministries were involved in the response. The Ministry of Health, through the Foreign Health Department, performed the health control on arrival. The whole operation was conducted at an air base. It included the health control of refugees composed of temperature measurement, a basic visual control and a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rapid antigen test for those over 12 years of age; the assessment of their basic needs (food and hygiene); identification and security procedures; and the initial administrative processing. The refugees were accommodated in a temporary facility at the base, where they waited to be transferred to their final destinations. Between 19 and 27 August 2021, 2168 refugees arrived on 17 flights; 680 of them were children under 12 years of age. One thousand four hundred and ninety-nine rapid antigen tests were performed, with one positive result. “Antigone Operation” is unprecedented in Spain and is one of the most complex operations carried out in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic required the establishment of a health control system on arrival, performed by Foreign Health, which contributed significantly to the overall success of the operation."

Social Determinants of Rural Household Food Insecurity under the Taliban Regime,"Wasiuddin Najam, Temitope Ibiyemi, Sajia Aziz, Rafiuddin Najam, Wanjiku N. Gichohi-Wainaina, Wilna Oldewage-Theron",https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15071681,2023-3-30,['Texas Tech University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Food Security', 'Agriculture']",,"### Summary of the Article

1. **Relevant Context**:
   Afghanistan has experienced significant political instability and conflict, particularly highlighted by the regime changes around 2000 and 2021. After the fall of the Taliban in 2001, international aid improved conditions, but the end of the U.S.-led mission in 2014 increased turmoil. The Taliban’s return to power in August 2021 led to further economic collapse, international sanctions, and loss of aid, which have worsened food insecurity.

2. **Purpose of the Research**:
   The study aims to address human rights questions related to food insecurity in Afghanistan, particularly the determinants and extent of this issue in rural areas post-Taliban takeover. It seeks to understand the impact of social determinants on household food insecurity (HFI) to inform targeted interventions and policies.

3. **Research Methods**:
   The research uses social determinants such as household head’s gender, education, size, agricultural activity, and income per member to analyze severe HFI in rural Afghanistan. It employs the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) to gather data and assess the prevalence and severity of food insecurity.

4. **Main Findings**:
   The study finds high levels of acute food insecurity affecting 47% of Afghanistan’s population in late 2021. Rural households, particularly female-headed ones, experience greater food insecurity. The loss of income from agriculture, exacerbated by natural disasters and Taliban-imposed restrictions on women, contributes to the crisis.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**:
   The article highlights the Taliban’s restrictive policies, particularly banning women from work and education, as significant factors exacerbating food insecurity by violating basic human rights and triggering the suspension of aid operations.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**:
   The authors conclude that interventions targeted at improving living conditions and food access are crucial. They recommend focusing on vulnerable populations by understanding key factors that increase food insecurity risk and developing suitable policies and interventions.

7. **Study Limitations**:
   The limitations include the challenging political climate under the Taliban, affecting data availability and collection accuracy. The sensitivity of human rights issues, particularly regarding the treatment of women, poses additional barriers to comprehensive analysis and intervention design.","Despite the severity of food insecurity in Afghanistan, little is known about the factors contributing to household food insecurity (HFI) under the Taliban regime. Therefore, this paper investigated the social determinants of severe HFI in rural areas of Afghanistan. We used the fifth-round survey of 6019 rural households from 25 provinces, collected between July and August 2022 by the Food and Agriculture Organization. We used binary logistic regression to examine the association between household characteristics and HFI. The majority of household heads were male (97.8%) with no education (62.8%). The findings showed that female-headed households had significantly higher odds of severe HFI. Household heads with any level of formal education had significantly reduced odds of severe HFI, while the odds of severe HFI was not different among those with religious/informal household-head education compared to those with no education. Likewise, engagement in any type of agricultural activity decreased the odds of severe HFI. Additionally, household income per member was negatively, while household size was positively associated with severe HFI. In summary, interventions to alleviate HFI among rural households should prioritize income-generating opportunities and skills targeting households with female heads, low levels of household-head education, larger size, no agricultural activities, and low income."

Modeling scenarios for ending poliovirus transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan,"Dominika A. Kalkowska, Kamran Badizadegan, Kimberly M. Thompson",https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.13983,2022-6-23,[],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"AbstractPakistan and Afghanistan pose risks for international transmission of polioviruses as the last global reservoir for wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and a reservoir for type 2 circulating vaccine‐derived polioviruses (cVDPV2s). Widespread transmission of WPV1 and cVDPV2 in 2019–2020 and resumption of intensive supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) in 2020–2021 using oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) led to decreased transmission of WPV1 and cVDPV2 as of the end of 2021. Using an established dynamic disease transmission model, we explore multiple bounding scenarios with varying intensities of SIAs using bivalent OPV (bOPV) and/or trivalent tOPV (tOPV) to characterize potential die out of transmission. This analysis demonstrates potential sets of actions that may lead to elimination of poliovirus transmission in Pakistan and/or Afghanistan. Some modeled scenarios suggest that Pakistan and Afghanistan could increase population immunity to levels high enough to eliminate transmission, and if maintained, achieve WPV1 and cVDPV2 elimination as early as 2022. This requires intensive and proactive OPV SIAs to prevent transmission, instead of surveillance followed by reactive outbreak response. The reduction of cases observed in 2021 may lead to a false sense of security that polio has already or soon will die out on its own, but relaxation of immunization activities runs the risk of lowering population immunity to, or below, the minimum die‐out threshold such that transmission continues. Transmission modeling may play a key role in managing expectations and supporting future modeling about the confidence of no virus circulation in anticipation of global certification decisions."
Effect of the Memory Training for Recovery-Adolescent Intervention vs Treatment as Usual on Psychiatric Symptoms among Adolescent Girls in Afghanistan: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Sayed Jafar Ahmadi, Laura Jobson, Zeinab Musavi, Sayed Rohullah Rezwani, Farshad Ahmad Amini, Arul Earnest, Nasratullah Samim, Sayed Ali Akbar Sarwary, Sayed Abbas Sarwary, Daniel McAvoy",https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.6086,2023-3-30,['Bard College'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Mental Health', 'Child and Adolescent Care', 'Migration', 'Psychosocial Support']",,"**1. Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
The study takes place in Afghanistan, a country with a long history of armed conflict, poverty, and social injustice, which has significantly impacted the mental health of its youth, especially adolescent girls. The situation worsened after the U.S. withdrawal and the Taliban's return to power in August 2021, creating an acute humanitarian crisis with high psychiatric distress among adolescents.

**2. Purpose and Research Questions:**
The research aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Memory Training for Recovery–Adolescent (METRA) intervention in reducing psychiatric symptoms among adolescent girls affected by war in Afghanistan. The study addressed challenges such as PTSD, depression, and other psychological issues in a humanitarian setting.

**3. Research Methods:**
The study was a randomized clinical trial conducted from November 2021 to March 2022 in Kabul. It included 125 adolescent girls aged 11-19 with psychiatric distress. Participants were randomly assigned to either METRA or treatment as usual (TAU). The METRA group underwent a 10-session intervention divided into modules targeting memory specificity and trauma writing, while the TAU group attended adolescent health sessions.

**4. Main Findings:**
The study found that METRA significantly reduced PTSD and depression symptoms compared to TAU, with improvements maintained after 3 months. Participants receiving METRA also showed greater reductions in anxiety, Afghan-cultural distress symptoms, and psychiatric difficulties.

**5. Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
The article does not provide a detailed examination of Afghanistan's legal frameworks, institutions, or policies related to human rights and mental health care. However, it highlights the lack of access to evidence-based interventions in low- and middle-income countries, including Afghanistan.

**6. Conclusions and Recommendations:**
The authors concluded that METRA is a feasible and effective intervention for addressing psychiatric symptoms in adolescents in humanitarian settings. Despite high dropout rates in METRA compared to TAU, the intervention's benefits suggest potential applicability in similar contexts. The study recommends further research to sustain and enhance METRA's effectiveness.

**7. Limitations:**
The study faced limitations related to the volatile political climate and security concerns, which influenced the trial design and recruitment efforts. The focus on girls from Kabul may limit generalizability. Additionally, the short-term follow-up and inability to monitor long-term effects of METRA pose limitations, along with the need for careful participant selection due to the nature of the intervention.","ImportanceAdolescents who experience conflict in humanitarian contexts often have high levels of psychiatric distress but rarely have access to evidence-based interventions.ObjectiveTo investigate the efficacy of Memory Training for Recovery–Adolescent (METRA) intervention in improving psychiatric symptoms among adolescent girls in Afghanistan.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis randomized clinical trial included girls and young women aged 11 to 19 years with heightened psychiatric distress living in Kabul, Afghanistan, and was conducted as a parallel-group trial comparing METRA with treatment as usual (TAU), with a 3-month follow-up. Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive either METRA or TAU. The study occurred between November 2021 and March 2022 in Kabul. An intention-to-treat approach was used.InterventionsParticipants assigned to METRA received a 10-session group-intervention comprised of 2 modules (module 1: memory specificity; module 2: trauma writing). The TAU group received 10 group adolescent health sessions. Interventions were delivered over 2 weeks.Main Outcomes and MeasuresPrimary outcome measures were self-reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms after the intervention. Secondary outcomes were self-reported measures of anxiety, Afghan-cultural distress symptoms, and psychiatric difficulties. Assessments occurred at baseline, after modules 1 and 2, and at 3 months after treatment.ResultsThe 125 participants had a mean (SD) age of 15.96 (1.97) years. Overall sample size for primary analyses included 80 adolescents in the METRA group and 45 adolescents in TAU. Following the intention-to-treat principle, generalized estimating equations found that the METRA group had a 17.64-point decrease (95% CI, −20.38 to −14.91 points) in PTSD symptoms and a 6.73-point decrease (95% CI, −8.50 to −4.95 points) in depression symptoms, while the TAU group had a 3.34-point decrease (95% CI, −6.05 to −0.62 points) in PTSD symptoms and a 0.66-point increase (95% CI, −0.70 to 2.01 points) in depression symptoms, with the group × time interactions being significant (allP &amp;amp;lt; .001). METRA participants had significantly greater reductions in anxiety, Afghan-cultural distress symptoms, and psychiatric difficulties than TAU participants. All improvements were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Dropout in the METRA group was 22.5% (18 participants) vs 8.9% for TAU (4 participants).Conclusions and RelevanceIn this randomized clinical trial, those in the METRA group had significantly greater improvements in psychiatric symptoms relative to those in the TAU group. METRA appeared to be a feasible and effective intervention for adolescents in humanitarian contexts.Trial Registrationanzctr.org.au Identifier:ACTRN12621001160820"

This study aims to document the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of seasonal influenza vaccine uptake among two priority groups, pregnant women (PWs) and healthcare workers (HCWs).MethodsThis cross‐sectional study enrolled PWs and HCWs in Kabul, Afghanistan, from September to December 2021. Data on vaccine intention and uptake, knowledge, and attitudes towards vaccination were collected. Simple linear regression was used to predict the impact of sociodemographic characteristics on the KAP score.ResultsA total of 420 PWs were enrolled in Afghanistan. The majority (89%) of these women had never heard of the influenza vaccine but 76% intended to receive the vaccine. Of the 220 HCWs enrolled, 88% were unvaccinated. Accessibility and cost were factors which encouraged vaccination among HCWs. Fear of side effects and affordability were identified as key barriers. HCWs reported high level of vaccine intention (93%). PWs aged under 18 years (β: 6.5, P = 0.004), between 18 and 24 years (β: 2.9, P = 0.014), currently employed (β: 5.8, P = 0.004), and vaccinated against COVID‐19 (β: 2.8, P = 0.01) were likely to have a higher attitude score. Among HCWs, being female was a predictor for poor vaccination practice (β: −1.33, P &lt; 0.001) whereas being vaccinated against COVID‐19 was a predictor for higher practice score (β: 2.4, P &lt; 0.001).ConclusionTo increase influenza vaccination coverage among priority groups, efforts should be made to address issues such as lack of knowledge, limited availability, and cost barriers."

To address these challenges, Baghch-e-Simsim ( BSS), a locally produced children’s television show, has focused on academic skills and gender equity for children and their families in Afghanistan. This paper will analyze the impact of BSS on the views of gender norms of children and parents using data from two studies: a nationally representative quasi-experimental evaluation of 3025 TV-viewing households and an in-depth qualitative encourage-to-view study of twenty households in Kabul. Overall findings will show that families who frequently view BSS have more gender equitable beliefs. Findings will also show that there is variability among parents on the appropriateness of boys and girls playing together outside, largely driven by security concerns rather than cultural gender norms. Recommendations will focus on the importance of continuing to create mass media content for young children that supports gender equity, but that content must also begin to reflect and address the security concerns facing parents that keep girls out of school.

One of the major reasons is the stigmas associated with the polio vaccine that has been repetitively discussed in literature, and governments of both the countries are already making serious efforts to control this public health challenge, but till this moment, the state officials have not introduced any surveillance strategy for the security of polio workers in National Emergency Action Plan (NEAP) for Polio Eradication. This report highlights the issue of targeted killing and terrorism attacks on polio vaccinators in Pakistan and also devises a surveillance strategy to provide security to polio workers at immediate possible because the current chaos in Afghanistan will ultimately lead to more terrorist attacks on polio vaccinators.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   - Social isolation is a significant concern for veterans transitioning from military to civilian life, exacerbated by trauma exposure and psychological distress. This issue was heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic due to restrictions on social interactions.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   - The research aimed to assess how social isolation impacts mental health and social functioning for veterans over the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. It focused on the association between isolation and emotional support, marriage quality, and couple satisfaction.

3. **Research Methods Used:**
   - This longitudinal study involved 188 U.S. veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Four bi-monthly assessments over six months were conducted. Multilevel modeling examined changes in social isolation and its relationship with mental health and social functioning, using person-centered and grand mean-centered isolation scores.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - Social isolation decreased slightly and then stabilized over time. Higher isolation correlated negatively with emotional support, mental health, relationship quality, and satisfaction. However, within-person prospective effects were nonsignificant.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies:**
   - The study did not focus on examining legal frameworks or policies related to veterans' rights or mental health.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - The authors concluded that while social isolation declines, it continues to affect veterans' mental health and relationships adversely. They emphasized the need for interventions targeting periods of high isolation, suggesting social engagement initiatives and therapeutic approaches.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   - Limitations include a lack of pre-pandemic data, brief measures that may not fully capture isolation experiences, and potential recall bias. The study's findings may not be generalizable beyond the early pandemic context or to veterans without clinical symptoms. Further research is needed to explore isolation's impact on veterans' mental health more comprehensively, including differences between isolation and loneliness.","Social isolation is a relevant problem for veterans who are at risk for disengaging from others as a function of transition stress from military life to civilian life, and given high rates of exposure to trauma and psychological distress. Few researchers have examined social isolation in veterans over time, particularly during COVID-19 that led to significant barriers and restrictions on social interactions. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to assess veterans’ experience of social isolation and its mental health and social functioning correlates during a 6-month period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 188 United States veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. A total of four assessments were administered: one every two months for a total duration of six months. The average number of completed assessments across all participants was 3.70 (SD = 0.75) with 159 participants (84.13%) completing all four timepoints. Surveys included measures of global mental health and social functioning as indicated by perceived emotional support, quality of marriage, and couple satisfaction. Multilevel modeling was used to assess 1) growth models to determine whether social isolation changed over time and the trajectory of that change (i.e., linear or quadratic); and 2) whether social isolation was related to both concurrent and prospective indicators of mental health and social functioning. All analyses included person mean centered and grand mean centered isolation to assess for within-and between-person effects. Veterans reported a quadratic trajectory in social isolation that decreased slightly and stabilized over time. Findings indicate that higher social isolation, at both the within- and between-person level, was negatively associated with concurrent emotional support, mental health, quality of marriage, and couple satisfaction. However, all prospective effects were nonsignificant at the within-person level. Results suggest although isolation may decrease over time, veterans report worse mental health and social functioning during times when they report higher levels of social isolation compared to themselves and others. Future work is needed to determine if interventions can be applied during those times to prevent or target those negative associations."

This article examines this ontological threat to the Afghan people to complement the security discussion and open up more avenues of dialog. I use ontological security to explain the Afghans’ behavior toward the Taliban takeover and ask how does the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan pose a security threat to urban Afghans? Why are urbanite Afghans paranoiac about the Taliban presence to the extent that some choose to die by falling from a moving aircraft? I use the ontological security analytical framework and discursive approach to finding answers. I argue that the Taliban takeover creates ontological insecurity that threatens urban Afghans’ sense of ordinary living or being in the world. Specifically, ontological insecurity creates significant and chronic uncertainties and dangers to Afghans. This is especially so regarding the urbanites with higher socioeconomic status, whose being in the world is threatened as their ordinary living conditions are likely to be contested by the Taliban. The contest is asymmetric, favoring the Taliban. Such uncertainty of existential conditions leads to mistrust of Urban Afghans’ basic sense of safety and a misrecognition of their true identity. Thus, their actions and behaviors have been consequent attempts to respond to the anxieties and risks to their existential position. This work contributes to the ontological security literature, helping fill the gap in the security discussions in international relations and serves policy relevance. "

Existing gaps and missed opportunities in delivering quality nutrition services in primary healthcare: a descriptive analysis of patient experience and provider competence in 11 low-income and middle-income countries,"Marwa Ramadan, Tonny B Muthee, Latifat Okara, Cameron Feil, Manuela Villar Uribe",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-064819,2023-2-28,['The World Bank Group'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Nutrition', 'Maternal Health', 'Food Security']",,"### Summary of the Article:

**1. Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
Over the last two decades, low and middle-income countries (LMICs) have seen progress in addressing nutrition-related issues, but they still face the dual challenge of undernutrition and obesity. This situation is complicated by increased food insecurity due to the COVID-19 pandemic and conflicts, particularly the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Primary healthcare (PHC) systems in these countries play a critical role in addressing these nutrition challenges, especially by integrating nutrition services into routine care for maternal, reproductive, newborn, and child health (RMNCH).

**2. Purpose of the Research:**
The study aims to assess the quality of nutrition services within PHC systems in LMICs, focusing on service delivery processes rather than just the availability of resources. It addresses human rights challenges related to access to quality nutrition services, especially considering the competence of providers and patients’ experiences during antenatal care (ANC) and child health visits.

**3. Research Methods:**
An observational cross-sectional design was used, analyzing publicly available health facility survey data (namely, the Service Provision Assessment - SPA) from 11 LMICs covering the period from 2007 to 2019. The analysis focused on two main aspects of PHC: patients’ experience and provider competence in delivering nutrition services.

**4. Main Findings:**
- Quality of nutrition services was generally low across the studied countries, with only the Democratic Republic of Congo scoring above 50% in both patient experience and provider competence.
- Providers in these nations often conducted basic nutrition assessments, like weight measurement, but failed to provide comprehensive counseling on nutrition, iron supplementation, or breastfeeding.
- Patient experiences with child nutrition services lagged behind maternal services, with low rates of counseling on child growth, feeding patterns, and nutrition education.

**5. Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
The study did not specifically examine the legal frameworks or policies. It highlighted the deficiency in service delivery quality at the PHC level rather than institutional structures.

**6. Conclusions and Recommendations:**
The study concludes that there is an urgent need to integrate quality nutrition services into PHC systems in LMICs. It emphasizes improving provider training to offer comprehensive nutritional advice and enhancing patient engagement during consultations. The authors recommend focusing on both facility and community-based services to improve health outcomes. They also suggest that future research should use mixed-effects models to better understand the variance between countries and consider community-based service delivery in evaluations.

**7. Limitations:**
The study's descriptive nature limits the ability to infer findings across different countries due to potential biases from varied geographic and temporal contexts. Additionally, available data was sometimes incomplete, and the study did not account for community-based nutrition services or factors such as non-communicable disease services. This limits the comprehensiveness of measuring nutrition service quality in PHC in the studied countries.","ObjectivesTo assess the competence of primary healthcare (PHC) providers in delivering maternal and child nutrition services at the PHC level and patients’ experience in receiving the recommended components of care.DesignObservational cross-sectional analysis.SettingHealthcare facilities in low/middle-income countries (LMICs) with available service provision assessment surveys (Afghanistan (2018), Democratic Republic of Congo (2018), Haiti (2017), Kenya (2010), Malawi (2013–2014), Namibia (2009), Nepal (2015), Rwanda (2007), Senegal (2018), Tanzania (2015) and Uganda (2007).Participants18 644 antenatal visits and 23 262 sick child visits in 8458 facilities across 130 subnational areas in 11 LMICs from 2007 to 2019.Outcomes(1) Provider competence assessed as the direct observations of actions performed during antenatal care (ANC) and sick child visits; and (2) patients’ experience defined as the self-reported awareness of the nutrition services received during ANC and sick child visits and provider effectiveness in delivering these services.ResultsExcept for DRC, all countries scored below 50% on patients’ experience and provider competence. More than 70% of clients were advised on taking iron supplements during pregnancy; however, less than 32% of patients were advised on iron side effects in all the studied countries. Across all countries, providers commonly took anthropometric measurements of expectant mothers and children; however, such assessments were rarely followed up with advice or counselling about growth patterns. In addition, less than 20% of observed providers advised on early/immediate breast feeding in all countries with available data.ConclusionThe 11 assessed countries demonstrated the delivery of limited nutrition services; nonetheless, the apparent deficiency in the extent and depth of questions asked for the majority of tracer activities revealed significant opportunities for improving the quality of nutrition service delivery at the PHC level."
"Unearthing Rabia's Grave: Placemaking, Shrines, and Contested Traditions in Balkh, Afghanistan",Shamim Homayun,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020743823000314,2023-2-27,['The Australian National University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Culture, Society, and Heritage', 'Human Rights']","['Religion', 'Traditional Practices', 'Gender', 'Civil Liberties']",,"The article explores the complex interplay of local traditions and national narratives surrounding the discovery and subsequent significance of Rabiʿa Balkhi’s shrine in Balkh, Afghanistan. 

1. **Historical and Social Context**: Historically, the interest in Rabiʿa reflects Afghanistan's broader cultural and nationalistic movements, particularly during the mid-20th century when an emergent nationalism sought to integrate various aspects of the country's past into a cohesive national identity. This included the celebration of classical poets and cultural figures like Rabiʿa, viewed as part of a cultural renaissance linked to Afghanistan's Persianate and Sufi heritage. 

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research aims to understand how local and national narratives about Rabiʿa Balkhi have been constructed and contested, reflecting broader dynamics in Afghan society relating to cultural heritage, national identity, and the negotiation between local traditions and centralized cultural policies.

3. **Research Methods**: The author uses a combination of ethnographic fieldwork, historical analysis of archival sources, and observation of cultural practices at Rabiʿa’s shrine. The study spans over a decade, from 2008 to 2019, including family visits and more formal anthropological research.

4. **Main Findings**: The study finds that the shrine is a site of contested narratives with Rabiʿa viewed variously as a Muslim saint, a feminist icon, and a symbol of Afghan nationalism. The shrine's history ties deeply to Afghanistan's mid-20th-century nationalistic projects, though local traditions and practices significantly shaped its current identity.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: Although not explicitly focused on legal frameworks, the study touches on cultural policies of the Afghan state, particularly efforts to control and regulate local shrine practices, which are often viewed skeptically by central authorities.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The author concludes that the shrine's narrative embodies a blend of local traditions and national imaginings, demonstrating resilience through conflict and change. The study suggests a need for recognizing the multiplicity of narratives and the role of local practices in shaping cultural heritage.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: Limitations include the challenge of verifying historical authenticity due to the lack of archaeological rigor in the shrine's initial excavation. The political complexities and potential censorship around discussing cultural narratives in Afghanistan could also limit the study. Additionally, the availability of reliable data and the sensitivity of discussing Rabiʿa as a feminist figure in a politically volatile region pose challenges.

Overall, the article highlights the entwined narratives of local spirituality and national identity, indicating the ongoing tension between central authority and local traditions in Afghanistan’s cultural history.","AbstractRabiʿa Balkhi was a princess and poet who, according to medieval accounts, flourished in 10th-century Balkh. She gained wide popularity in 20th-century Afghanistan, where she has been the subject of books, poems, and movies. This article recounts the story of her grave's discovery in the center of Balkh's town park in the 1960s, the emergence of a shrine around it, and its integration with Balkh's landscape of antiquity. Drawing on parallels from across the Muslim world, I argue that Rabiʿa's shrine emerged through a dialogue between state officials and local forms of placemaking. But although initially motivated by nationalist sentiment, the Afghan state lost its ability to define Rabiʿa's life on nationalist terms. As Afghanistan fragmented through war, her shrine survived as a space where her life was constantly reinterpreted and where disputed visions over the nation's past and future played out."

Wren",https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.0484,2023-2-23,['Stanford University School of Medicine'],Article,1,Yes,"['Security and Conflict', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Veterans', 'Military Actions', 'Maternal Health', 'Disease Prevention']",,"**Summary of the Article: Factors Associated with Moral Injury and Distress (MID) in Deployed Military Surgeons**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:** Military surgeons operate in active combat zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, providing medical care to injured soldiers and civilians under significant stress and limited resources. The operational environment does not correspond to any civilian medical settings, making evaluation and measurement of moral injury and distress unique and challenging.

2. **Purpose of the Research:** The study aimed to explore and characterize moral injury and distress among deployed military surgeons during periods of high casualty volumes. It focused on understanding how moral distress impacts military surgeons who operate under specific military rules of engagement.

3. **Research Methods Used:** This study employed a mixed-methods qualitative approach from May to October 2020, using the Measure of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals (MMD-HP) survey and individual interviews with 20 US military surgeons deployed during specified periods in Iraq and Afghanistan.

4. **Main Findings:** The study revealed two primary domains of MID for military surgeons: distressing outcomes (DO) and medical rules of engagement (MROE). Distressing outcomes included witnessing horrific injuries, treating vulnerable populations like children and pregnant women, and experiencing self-doubt in decision-making. MROE stressors involved the forced transfer of civilian patients, limited resources, and poor communication with command. MID often manifested in post-deployment issues such as sleep disturbances, challenges in interpersonal relationships, and reduced confidence in medical practice.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:** The study highlighted how military rules of engagement (MROE) placed ethical and operational burdens on military surgeons, signifying that the legal and ethical demands of military duties potentially conflicted with medical ethics and the surgeons' well-being.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:** The authors concluded that MID is a prevalent issue among military surgeons, necessitating the development of specific tools for evaluation and intervention. Recommendations include adapting existing moral distress measurement tools to better address the unique conditions faced by military healthcare professionals in combat zones.

7. **Limitations:** The study's small sample size limits its generalizability. Recall bias is another limitation due to the retrospective nature of the interviews. Additionally, the study underscores the need for measurement tools specific to the military context, as civilian models may not capture the full scope of MID experienced by combat surgeons. The complex political and operational environment can also restrict the generalizability and application of such findings in broader contexts.","ImportanceMoral injury and distress (MID), which occurs when individuals have significant dissonance with their belief system and overwhelming feelings of being powerless to do what is believed to be right, has not been explored in the unique population of military surgeons deployed far forward in active combat settings. Deployed military surgeons provide care to both injured soldiers and civilians under command-driven medical rules of engagement (MROE) in variably resourced settings. This practice setting has no civilian corollary for comparison or current specific tool for measurement.ObjectiveTo characterize MID among military surgeons deployed during periods of high casualty volumes through a mixed-methods approach.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis qualitative study using convergent mixed methods was performed from May 2020 to October 2020. Participants included US military surgeons who had combat deployments to a far-forward role 2 treatment facility during predefined peak casualty periods in Iraq (2003-2008) and Afghanistan (2009-2012), as identified by purposeful snowball sampling. Data analysis was performed from October 2020 to May 2021.Main Outcomes and MeasuresMeasure of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals (MMD-HP) survey and individual, semistructured interviews were conducted to thematic saturation.ResultsThe total cohort included 20 surgeons (mean [SD] age, 38.1 [5.2] years); 16 (80%) were male, and 16 (80%) had 0 or 1 prior deployment. Deployment locations were Afghanistan (11 surgeons [55%]), Iraq (9 surgeons [45%]), or both locations (3 surgeons [15%]). The mean (SD) MMD-HP score for the surgeons was 104.1 (39.3). The primary thematic domains for MID were distressing outcomes (DO) and MROE. The major subdomains of DO were guilt related to witnessing horrific injuries; treating pregnant women, children, and US soldiers; and second-guessing decisions. The major subdomains for MROE were forced transfer of civilian patients, limited capabilities and resources, inexperience in specialty surgical procedures, and communication with command. Postdeployment manifestations of MID were common and affected sleep, medical practice, and interpersonal relationships.Conclusions and RelevanceIn this qualitative study, MID was ubiquitous in deployed military surgeons. Thematic observations about MID, specifically concerning the domains of DO and MROE, may represent targets for further study to develop an evaluation tool of MID in this population and inform possible programs for identification and mitigation of MID."

After the collapse of the Afghan Government on 15 August 2021, the health system has been on the brink of collapse. Aims: We assessed the use of basic health services and estimated excess mortality resulting from the interruption to healthcare funding. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study that compared health services utilization from June to September for 3 consecutive years, 2019, 2020 and 2021, using 11 output indicators reported by the health management and information system. We used the Lives Saved Tool, a linear mathematical model with input data from the Afghanistan Demographic Health Survey 2015, to calculate the additional maternal, neonatal and child mortality at 25%, 50%, 75% and 95% reduction in health coverage. Results: During August and September 2021, after the announced ban on financing, health service utilization decreased to a range of 7–59%. Family planning, major surgeries and postnatal care showed the greatest decreases. Uptake of child immunization showed one-third decrease. Sehatmandi provides around 75% of primary and secondary health services: pausing funds to this programme will result in additional 2862 maternal deaths, 15 741 neonatal deaths, 30 519 child deaths, and 4057 stillbirths. Conclusion: Sustaining the current level of health services delivery is crucial to avoid excess, preventable morbidity and mortality in Afghanistan."
Assessing the relationship between operationally defined zero-dose communities and access to selected primary healthcare services for children and pregnant women in emergency settings,"Mark P. Suprenant, Elevanie Nyankesha, Ralfh Moreno-Garcia, Valentina Buj, Ahmadu Yakubu, Fouzia Shafique, Muhammad H. Zaman",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281764,2023-2-16,['Boston University College of Engineering'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Maternal Health', 'Disease Prevention', 'Migration']",,"1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   - The study focuses on the relationship between ""zero-dose"" communities and access to healthcare in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. These countries represent varying emergency contexts, including systemic conflict in Afghanistan, localized unrest in DRC, and migration crises like the Rohingya situation in Bangladesh. Such crises often hamper healthcare access.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   - The research aims to investigate how access to the first dose of the Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTP1) vaccine correlates with other healthcare services for children and pregnant women. It addresses the challenge of healthcare access in zero-dose communities where children often lack vaccinations.

3. **Research Methods:**
   - Data from Demographic Health Surveys (2014: DRC, 2015: Afghanistan, 2018: Bangladesh) was used. Analyses included Chi-Squared tests and linear regression to explore associations between DTP1 vaccination and healthcare access. The study distinguished between scheduled (e.g., antenatal care) and unscheduled services (e.g., treatment for illnesses).

4. **Main Findings:**
   - There is a significant association between DTP1 coverage and scheduled healthcare services like antenatal care and skilled birth assistance. However, a linear relationship was not observed for unscheduled illness treatments. In DRC, a strong linear correlation was found between DTP1 and Vitamin A supplementation in conflict regions, but not at the national level.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   - While the study does not directly examine legal frameworks, it highlights systemic issues in healthcare access during emergencies, indirectly suggesting gaps in existing policies and support systems.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - The authors concluded that DTP1 coverage could be a useful indirect measure for estimating access to certain healthcare services in emergency settings. They recommend that healthcare planners use the proportion of zero-dose children to prioritize regions needing vaccination and healthcare services. The study advocates for better targeting of zero-dose communities to improve healthcare access.

7. **Limitations:**
   - Limitations include reliance on aggregated data, which may not capture local nuances. The political climate in the studied countries could affect data collection and accuracy. The study primarily provides a snapshot rather than a detailed map of healthcare access across different regions and services. Future research should explore localized correlations between zero-dose communities and healthcare access, particularly for unscheduled services.","In this study the authors examine the relationship between “zero-dose” communities and access to healthcare services. This was done by first ensuring the first dose of the Diphtheria Tetanus and Pertussis vaccine was a better measure of zero-dose communities than the measles-containing vaccine. Once ensured, it was used to examine the association with access to primary healthcare services for children and pregnant women in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. These services were divided into: a) unscheduled healthcare services such as birth assistance as well as seeking care and treatment for diarrheal diseases and cough/fever episodes and b) other scheduled health services such as antenatal care visits and vitamin A supplementation. Using recent Demographic Health Survey data (2014: Democratic Republic of Congo, 2015: Afghanistan, 2018: Bangladesh), data was analyzed via Chi Squared analysis or Fischer’s Exact Test. If significant, a linear regression analysis was performed to examine if the association was linear. While the linear relationship observed between children who had received the first dose of the Diphtheria Tetanus and Pertussis vaccine (the reverse to zero-dose communities) and coverage of other vaccines was expected, the results of the regression analysis depicted an unexpected split in behavior. For scheduled and birth assistance health services, a linear relationship was generally observed. For unscheduled services associated with illness treatments, this was not the case. While it does not appear that the first dose of the Diphtheria Tetanus and Pertussis vaccine can be used to predict (at least in a linear manner) access to some primary (particularly illness treatment) healthcare services in emergency/ humanitarian settings, it can serve as an indirect measure of health services not associated with the treatment of childhood infections such as antenatal care, skilled birth assistance, and to a lesser degree even vitamin A supplementation."
Inequalities in Childhood Immunisation in South Asia,"Madhu Sudhan Atteraya, In Han Song, Nasser B. Ebrahim, Shreejana Gnawali, Eungi Kim, Thakur Dhakal",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20031755,2023-1-18,['Keimyung University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Disease Prevention', 'Maternal Health', 'Gender']",,"**Summary of the Article:**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The article examines childhood immunisation in South Asian countries, highlighting significant disparities both within and between Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. South Asia, with its diverse and dense population, faces substantial health challenges due to rapid but inequitable socioeconomic development. The World Health Organization's (WHO) Extended Programme on Immunization (EPI) since 1974 aimed to combat child mortality worldwide, yet full immunisation remains elusive in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The study aims to identify inequalities in childhood immunisation rates across South Asian countries and analyze socio-demographic factors impacting immunisation. It addresses disparities in vaccine access, challenging the achievement of universal childhood immunisation and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study uses a descriptive statistical analysis, chi-square tests, independent samples t-tests, and logistic regression to investigate immunisation rates. Data were derived from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, involving children aged 12 to 23 months.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - Immunisation rates are low in Afghanistan (42.6% fully immunised) and vary widely in other countries: Bangladesh (88.2%), India (77.1%), Nepal (79.2%), and Pakistan (62.2%).
   - Factors influencing immunisation include maternal education, socioeconomic status, and geographic location, with significant disparities noted. For instance, rural children in India were more likely to be fully immunised than those in urban areas.
   - Inequalities persist due to various barriers like household poverty, educational disparities, and cultural factors.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   Although the study does not focus directly on legal frameworks, it discusses the role of policies like India’s Routine Immunisation programme and the UN's Millennium Development Goals regarding education and healthcare access, which indirectly affect immunisation rates.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that achieving universal childhood immunisation in South Asia remains challenging due to socio-demographic inequalities. They recommend using the findings to inform policy development and interventions to improve public health outcomes and achieve SDGs for health and wellbeing.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   Limitations include the absence of data from Bhutan and Sri Lanka, potential biases from self-reported data, and difficulties in capturing complex socio-political dynamics. The study acknowledges challenges in data availability and political sensitivity within the region, which might affect comprehensive analysis and interpretation.","Identifying the inequalities associated with immunisation coverage among children is crucial. We investigated the factors associated with complete immunisation among 12- to 23-month-old children in five South Asian countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, using nationally representative data sets from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Descriptive statistics, bivariate association, and logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the prevalence and the factors in each country that affect the likelihood of full childhood immunisation coverage. The complete childhood immunisation coverage varied significantly within each country in South Asia. Afghanistan had the lowest immunisation rates (42.6%), whereas Bangladesh ranked the highest in complete childhood immunisation rates, at 88.2%. Similarly, 77.1% of Indian children, 79.2% of Nepali children, and 62.2% of Pakistani children were completely immunised. Household wealth status strongly correlated with full childhood immunisation in Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan at the bivariate level. The results from the logistic regression showed that a higher maternal educational level had a statistically significant association with complete childhood immunisation in all countries compared to mothers who did not attend any school. In conclusion, the study revealed the inequalities of complete childhood immunisation within South Asia. Governments must be proactive in their endeavours to address universal and equitable vaccine coverage in collaboration with national and international stakeholders and in line with the relevant Sustainable Development Goals."

Bogush, Abdul Qayeum Karim, Janay Sagintayev, Sam Towers, Hugh Christopher Greenwell",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40899-022-00808-9,2022-12-17,['Durham University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Environment', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Water Quality', 'Groundwater Contamination', 'Disease Prevention', 'Waterborne Disease']",,"The article titled ""Statistical results of hydrochemical parameters"" examines the quality of groundwater in Kabul city over time, focusing on issues of contamination that have implications for public health and human rights.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Kabul, Afghanistan, has experienced rapid urban growth and lacks proper wastewater management systems. Most households use pit latrines, which contributes to groundwater pollution, a critical issue given the reliance on groundwater for drinking.

2. **Purpose of Research**: The study aims to assess the extent and impact of groundwater contamination on human health in Kabul. It addresses the challenge of ensuring safe drinking water, which is a fundamental human right, amidst rising pollution levels.

3. **Research Methods**: The study involves statistical analysis of hydrochemical parameters from 41 groundwater samples taken in 2020 and compares them with data from 2007. Measurements include pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness (TH), nitrate, and biological contamination by E. coli.

4. **Main Findings**: The study reveals significant groundwater contamination in Kabul, with nitrate levels exceeding by up to tenfold the safe drinking limits set by WHO. The water quality index (WQI) indicates a deterioration in water quality from 2007 to 2020, making much of the groundwater unsuitable for consumption. High levels of E. coli demonstrate widespread biological contamination.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: While the study does not explicitly analyze legal frameworks, the results imply an inadequacy in current policies and infrastructural responses to water management and contamination control.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that groundwater contamination poses a significant public health risk, exacerbating waterborne diseases and child mortality rates in Kabul. They recommend urgent interventions to improve wastewater treatment and public health systems to address this growing crisis.

7. **Limitations**: The study's limitations include potential biases due to data availability and the sensitivity of conducting research in a politically unstable region. Given the socio-political climate, comprehensive data collection and infrastructure improvements are challenging, which hampers effective mitigation strategies.

Overall, this article underscores the severe and increasing threat that groundwater contamination poses to human health in Kabul, urging improvements in both infrastructure and health interventions to safeguard citizens' rights to safe drinking water.","AbstractThe management of groundwater in densely populated areas with no centralized water treatment is critical for the prevention of diseases and maintaining sanitation. Here, we determine the bacteriological and chemical characteristics of groundwater in Kabul city, a resource that 4.1 million individuals rely on. Groundwater samples were analyzed from 41 newly established piezometric wells across Kabul, and data were compared with the last detailed study, undertaken in 2007, to understand contamination trends in an area that has undergone significant development and social changes. Piper diagrams, Gibbs diagrams, correlation analysis, and bivariate plots examine the hydrogeochemical and natural occurring processes of groundwater. The average concentration of cations followed the order Na+  &gt; Mg2+  &gt; Ca2+  &gt; K+, and anions HCO3− &gt; NO3− &gt; Cl− &gt; SO42− &gt; F with Gibbs diagrams indicating mainly rock-weathering influence groundwater chemistry. An increase in nitrate (NO3−) and E. coli indicates anthropogenic activities impacting the shallow groundwater quality, with significantly elevated nitrate (over 50 mg/L) and E. coli (up to 250 CFU/100 mL). The increasing presence of E. coli and NO3− in the shallow groundwater of Kabul city in turn suggests problematic links to the prevalence of waterborne diseases. Additionally, the water quality index (WQI) was used to assess groundwater quality, and rank its suitability for drinking purposes. The WQI analysis showed that less than 35% of shallow groundwater samples had good water quality. The findings of this study are crucial for the development and sustainable management of groundwater in the city. In short term, we propose interventions such as point-of-use (POU) water purification which may offer temporary respite for waterborne disease prevention. Kabul city requires immediate attention to developing sustainable groundwater management policies, expansion of the water supply network, groundwater quality monitoring, and wastewater management."

We comparatively focus on the effects of geopolitically powerful states – China and the United States – and their influence over the use of surveillance technologies in the name of spatial security in relatively weaker states – Nepal and Afghanistan. We use these two areas of comparison to address the similarities in security logics across disparate spaces and to highlight the everyday experiences and responses to both outside influence from powerful states and national security regimes. Through interview data from our respective qualitative research in Afghanistan and Nepal, we show how the logics of security situates particular racialized and gendered bodies as suspicious and examine how individuals living in these spaces experience, understand, and challenge these security regimes. We conclude by arguing for more comparative studies of security technologies and surveillance regimes. Additionally, we view these spaces of heightened security as potential sites for increased violence, rather than security. "
Capacity and quality of maternal and child health services delivery at the subnational primary healthcare level in relation to intermediate health outputs: a cross-sectional study of 12 low-income and middle-income countries,"Marwa Ramadan, Jose Carlos Gutierrez, Cameron Feil, Sarah Bolongaita, Oscar Bernal, Manuela Villar Uribe",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-065223,2023-1-31,['The World Bank Group'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Governance']","['Maternal Health', 'Disease Prevention']",,"**Summary of the Article:**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The article highlights a renewed global commitment to Primary Health Care (PHC), with significant policy shifts from the Millennium Development Goals to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2016, particularly the focus on ""Achieving Universal Healthcare Coverage"". This shift moved the global health agenda towards strengthening health systems, away from individual health interventions. The 2018 Astana Declaration reaffirms global commitment to PHC.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research aims to address measurement gaps in understanding the relationship between PHC system capacity, quality, and performance at the subnational level in 12 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It seeks to examine PHC service delivery and its association with health outputs like coverage and service access, addressing challenges in the performance measurement of PHC systems.

3. **Research Methods Used:**
   The study employs a cross-sectional analysis using Service Provision Assessment (SPA) surveys and Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) to evaluate PHC service delivery and health outputs. The study applies SPA weights and bivariate and multivariable models, adjusting for facility and population-level characteristics to compute subnational estimates.

4. **Main Findings and Human Rights Violations/Trends:**
   There is substantial heterogeneity in PHC capacity and quality across countries and subnational areas, with disparities in infrastructure, service provision, and immunisation outcomes. Geographical disparities in PHC capacity and quality are prevalent within countries. Service delivery subdomains were more statistically significant when associated with child health outputs than maternal health outputs.

5. **Examination of Country's Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   The study notes methodological and data challenges in measuring PHC quality, emphasizing the importance of subnational monitoring and tailored policy solutions based on region-specific needs.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The study highlights the necessity for granular monitoring of PHC performance and investment in the training and development of healthcare providers to address capacity issues. It recommends the disaggregation of national health indicators for subnational insights to identify system bottlenecks and improve healthcare delivery.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The observational and cross-sectional nature of the study precludes causal interpretations. Data aggregation at the subnational level may lead to ecological fallacies, and differences between survey timelines (SPA and DHS) could affect outcomes. The limited sample size in Afghanistan, primarily urban areas, presents additional constraints, and potential biases exist due to unmeasured factors in the surveys.

The study suggests a tailored approach to PHC improvement, emphasizing the need for granular tools and frameworks to enhance the understanding of healthcare delivery across diverse settings.","ObjectivesTo examine the capacity and quality of maternal and child health (MCH) services at the subnational primary healthcare (PHC) level in 12 low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and its association with intermediate health outputs such as coverage and access to care.DesignObservational cross-sectional study using matched subnational data from service provision assessment surveys and demographic health surveys from 2007 to 2019.Settings138 subnational areas with available survey data in 12 LMICs (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nepal, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda).OutcomesEight intermediate MCH outcomes/outputs were explored: (1) met need for family planning by modern methods; (2) attendance of four or more antenatal care visits; (3) perceived financial barriers to care; (4) perceived geographical barriers to care; (5) diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) third dose coverage; (6) DPT dropout-rate; (7) care-seeking for pneumonia; and (8) oral rehydration solutions coverage.ResultsOverall, moderate-to-poor PHC performance was observed across the 12 countries, with substantial heterogeneity between the different subnational areas in the same country as well as within the same subnational area across both capacity and quality subdomains. The analysis of the relationship between PHC service delivery and child health outcomes revealed that recent supervision (b=0.34, p&lt;0.01) and supervisors’ feedback (b=0.28, p&lt;0.05) were each associated with increased care-seeking for pneumonia. We also observed the associations of several measures of capacity and quality with DPT immunisation. The analysis of maternal health outcomes yielded only a few statistically significant results at p&lt;0.05 level, however, none remained significant after adjusting for other covariates.ConclusionThe results of this analysis illustrate the heterogeneity in the capacity and quality of PHC service delivery within LMICs. Countries seeking to strengthen their PHC systems could improve PHC monitoring at the subnational level to better understand subnational bottlenecks in service delivery."
"Disability types, determinants and healthcare utilisation amongst Afghan adults: a secondary analysis of the Model Disability Survey of Afghanistan","Khalidha Nasiri, Nadia Akseer, Hana Tasic, Hadia Rafiqzad, Tabasum Akseer",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062362,2023-1-30,"['Schulich School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry', 'Modern Scientist Global']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Human Rights']","['COVID-19', 'Disability Rights']",,"Here's a comprehensive summary of the article focusing on the key points specified:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**:
   Afghanistan has faced decades of instability and conflict, compounded by the recent COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing humanitarian crisis, and natural disasters. The healthcare system struggles with poor accessibility, particularly in rural areas, exacerbated further by the US withdrawal and the Taliban takeover, which has increased the nation's humanitarian and health needs.

2. **Purpose of the Research**:
   The research aims to understand the Afghan adult population with moderate or severe disability (MSD) across seven domains: communication and cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along with people, life activities, participation in society, and body functions. It addresses the need for equitable healthcare access, a human right emphasized by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the challenge of achieving health equity in Afghanistan.

3. **Research Methods**:
   The study utilized data from the 2019 Model Disability Survey of Afghanistan (MDSA), employing a stratified multistage sample design. Multivariable hierarchical logistic regression was used to identify drivers of the high disability burden. Data collection was comprehensive across the 34 provinces, with stakeholder consultations and tool validation.

4. **Main Findings**:
   - MSD is highly prevalent across several domains in Afghanistan, with notable variations in determinants and healthcare utilization patterns depending on disability type.
   - Key risk factors include lack of education, unemployment, rural residence, and Pashtun ethnicity.
   - Protective factors are better climate, access to healthcare, mobile phones, and internet, as well as peer support and positive self-perception.
   - Healthcare costs are a significant barrier to accessing necessary care.
   - Overall, wait times and satisfaction with the healthcare system are rated poorly, especially among those with mobility and body function disabilities.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**:
   While the study does not specifically evaluate Afghanistan’s legal frameworks, the research context implicitly critiques the inadequacy of current policies and suggests areas for policy development, such as broader community-based education and healthcare access initiatives.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**:
   The authors suggest improving community-level determinants and access to healthcare to address the high disability burden. They recommend incorporating disability awareness in healthcare professional education, promoting inclusive policies, and updating Afghanistan’s National Disability Prevention and Physical Rehabilitation Strategic Plan. Dialogue with the Taliban to maintain health system services is crucial, with emphasis on women's and children's education and health issues.

7. **Limitations of the Study**:
   The study is limited by the country’s unstable political climate and potential data collection challenges due to security concerns. There might also be limitations regarding data availability and the sensitivity of addressing human rights issues in such a context.

This study highlights crucial areas of need and potential intervention targeting MSD in Afghanistan, emphasizing the importance of cross-sectoral collaboration and policy development to improve disability rights and healthcare access.","ObjectivesThe needs of people with disability in Afghanistan are not well understood. We describe the characteristics, healthcare utilisation patterns, and experience of care among Afghan adults with moderate or severe disability (MSD) by disability type.DesignWe mapped 47 questions related to functional disability in the cross-sectional Model Disability Survey of Afghanistan (MDSA) 2019 into 7 disability domains based on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. We conducted multivariable hierarchical logistic regression to identify drivers of high disability burden.SettingThe MDSA primary sampling unit were villages in rural areas and neighbourhoods in urban areas, and the secondary sample units were the settlements within districts.ParticipantsThe MDSA collected data for 14 520 households across all 34 provinces. The adult tool of the survey was administered to a randomly selected household member aged 18 years or older.Main outcome measuresThe main outcome measured was moderate or severe disability (MSD), which was estimated using a Rasch composite score.ResultsMSD prevalence was upwards of 35% in 6/7 domains. Across most disability types, being a woman, older age, residing in rural areas, being uneducated, non-Pashtun ethnicity, being unmarried, living in a household in the low-income tertiles and a non-working household had the highest levels of MSD (p&lt;0.05). Determinants of MSD varied by domain; however, variables including better access to health facilities and better experience of care (higher satisfaction with time spent and respect during visits) were generally protective. People with MSD in the self-care and life activities domains had the highest and lowest healthcare utilisation, respectively.ConclusionsDisability in Afghanistan is at public health crisis levels, with vulnerable populations being impacted most severely. To ensure progress towards Afghanistan’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, targeted interventions for disability types based on population risk factors should be implemented."
Taliban decree deepens Afghanistan's health crisis: Ban on female NGO staff hampers critical aid work and jeopardizes polio eradication campaign,Leslie Roberts,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adg7351,,[],Note,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,Ban on female NGO staff hampers critical aid work and jeopardizes polio eradication campaign
Female Afghan engineers’ perceptions of chokepoints along the career trajectory to entrepreneurship,"Muzhda Mehrzad, S.W.S.B. Dasanayaka, Kimberly Gleason, Praneeth Wijesinghe, Omar Al Serhan",https://doi.org/10.1108/JEEE-11-2020-0410,2021-10-27,['American University of Afghanistan'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"
Purpose
The purpose of this study is to explore the perceptions of Afghan female engineers regarding opportunities and barriers to starting their own engineering/construction company in Kabul through three career trajectory chokepoints related to training through higher education, the engineering workplace and entrepreneurship, through the lens of feminist theory.


Design/methodology/approach
Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted. A Web-based survey was also conducted to collect data from participants who were not able to participate in the in-depth interviews. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the collected data.


Findings
As a result of the analysis, three main themes were developed related to “chokepoints” that Afghan female engineers face along the path to starting their own construction companies: “entering and studying engineering,” “career development” and “starting her own engineering business”; the authors address the subthemes of barriers and opportunities confronted by Afghan women at each chokepoint.


Research limitations/implications
Due to civil unrest, the authors are only able to reach a sample of Afghan female engineers working in the capital city of Kabul.


Practical implications
Afghanistan shows, perhaps, the most severe underrepresentation of female engineers of all countries in the world, yet no research gives them a voice to explain the challenges their face to starting their own engineering/construction businesses. The authors are able to report their perceptions and articulate recommendations to encourage female entrepreneurship in the engineering/construction sector in Afghanistan.


Social implications
Afghan women face significant barriers to having meaningful careers in the science, technology, engineering and medicine professions. The findings provide information for regulators regarding why Afghan women do not start their own engineering firms.


Originality/value
As physical security and resource constraints generate difficulty in accessing Afghan women in general, this is the first paper to report the perceptions of Afghan female engineers regarding the barriers and opportunities they perceive on the path to engineering entrepreneurship.

Decision-making processes for essential packages of health services: Experience from six countries,"Rob Baltussen, Omar Mwalim, Karl Blanchet, Manuel Carballo, Getachew Teshome Eregata, Alemayehu Hailu, Maryam Huda, Mohamed Jama, Kjell Arne Johansson, Teri Reynolds, Wajeeha Raza, Jacque Mallender, Reza Majdzadeh",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2022-010704,2023-1-19,['Radboud University Medical Center'],Review,1,Yes,"['Governance', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Policy Reform', 'Disease Prevention']",,"The article reviews the experiences of six countries—Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, and Zanzibar—in revising their Essential Packages of Health Services (EPHS). This effort is situated within the broader historical and policy context of global efforts toward achieving universal health coverage (UHC), which aims to ensure that all people have access to the health services they need without suffering financial hardship.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Many countries are striving for UHC, and EPHS serve as a central policy instrument to define the scope of covered health services and the financial schemes behind them. This policy framework is a reflection of global health objectives established by organizations like the World Health Organization to address health inequities and improve public health outcomes universally.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions**: The research addresses the challenge of organizing and revising EPHS decision-making processes. It emphasizes the importance of involving stakeholders to ensure fairness and impact, aligning with the human rights principle of participation in decision-making processes that affect one's health. 

3. **Research Methods**: The study employs an analytical framework that encompasses three interrelated topics: practical organization, fairness, and institutionalization of EPHS revision processes. This approach was applied to review the experiences of the six countries, using country-specific templates and consultations with local informants involved in EPHS management from 2019 to 2022.

4. **Main Findings**: The study found that while countries used similar stepwise approaches to EPHS revision, they differed in their implementation of these steps. Key steps include forming advisory committees, mapping services, defining decision criteria, collecting evidence, and involving stakeholders. Transparency, stakeholder involvement, and institutionalization were identified as crucial factors for effective EPHS revisions.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The article discusses institutionalization, recommending countries establish legal frameworks to sustain EPHS through regulation, governance institutions, and adequate resource allocation. Ethiopia, for example, has institutionalized its EPHS revision process to enhance sustainability.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: Authors conclude that the examined framework is valid and suggest countries follow the outlined stepwise approach, adapting it to their contexts. Emphasis is placed on stakeholder involvement and transparency. It's advised that EPHS processes be institutionalized to avoid being one-time projects but rather ongoing activities embedded in the health system.

7. **Limitations**: The study notes that political will and support are critical, and that lessons were drawn from successful country experiences only, potentially overlooking challenges faced by less successful countries. Data availability and regional context-sensitive factors also pose limitations on the study’s applicability elsewhere.

The study highlights the complex interplay between health policy-making, stakeholder involvement, and sustainable institutional practices, all of which are essential for advancing the right to health in these countries.","Many countries around the world strive for universal health coverage, and an essential packages of health services (EPHS) is a central policy instrument for countries to achieve this. It defines the coverage of services that are made available, as well as the proportion of the costs that are covered from different financial schemes and who can receive these services. This paper reports on the development of an analytical framework on the decision-making process of EPHS revision, and the review of practices of six countries (Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan and Zanzibar-Tanzania).The analytical framework distinguishes the practical organisation, fairness and institutionalisation of decision-making processes. The review shows that countries: (1) largely follow a similar practical stepwise process but differ in their implementation of some steps, such as the choice of decision criteria; (2) promote fairness in their EPHS process by involving a range of stakeholders, which in the case of Zanzibar included patients and community members; (3) are transparent in terms of at least some of the steps of their decision-making process and (4) in terms of institutionalisation, express a high degree of political will for ongoing EPHS revision with almost all countries having a designated governing institute for EPHS revision.We advise countries to organise meaningful stakeholder involvement and foster the transparency of the decision-making process, as these are key to fairness in decision-making. We also recommend countries to take steps towards the institutionalisation of their EPHS revision process."
Using costing to facilitate policy making towards Universal Health Coverage: Findings and recommendations from country-level experiences,"Sylvestre Gaudin, Wajeeha Raza, Jolene Skordis, Agnès Soucat, Karin Stenberg, Ala Alwan",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2022-010735,2023-1-19,['Oberlin College and Conservatory'],Review,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Health Systems Strengthening', 'Policy Reform, Costing and Budgeting']",,"The article examines the experiences of five low-income and lower middle-income countries (LLMICs)—Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Somalia, and Sudan—in the process of estimating the costs of their Essential Packages of Health Services (EPHS). The study focuses on the challenges faced during these costing exercises to aid future efforts in achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC), a goal outlined in the UN's 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

**1. Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
Since the adoption of the SDGs in 2015, LLMICs have been working to define and implement EPHS as part of their healthcare strategies to achieve UHC. Estimating the cost of these packages is crucial to ensure they are feasible within budget constraints and not merely aspirational.

**2. Purpose of the Research:**
The research aims to identify challenges and successes in costing EPHS, which can facilitate better implementation and policy decisions. It addresses how accurate cost estimation can aid in policy dialogues, budget discussions, and financing mobilization for UHC.

**3. Research Methods:**
A systematic survey was employed to gather data from technical costing teams in six countries, with responses from five. The survey included both factual and normative questions on methodology, capacity, data issues, and the impact of cost estimates on policy decisions.

**4. Main Findings:**
- Costing exercises varied widely among countries in methodology and design.
- Significant capacity gaps were noted, with high proportions of team members lacking prior costing skills.
- Primary data collection often complemented national data sources, emphasizing the challenges of data availability.
- Sensitivity analysis was limited, affecting the reliability of cost estimates.
- Costing results were mostly used for advisory meetings, prioritizing interventions, and securing funding rather than direct budgeting, indicating a disconnect from annual or long-term budget planning.

**5. Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
The study does not specifically focus on legal frameworks but emphasizes the need for high-quality cost estimates to facilitate effective communication with policymakers, which indirectly relates to influencing legal and institutional frameworks for health financing.

**6. Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
The authors highlight the need for building long-term institutional capacity in costing to improve policy relevance and decision-making utility. They recommend integrating sensitivity analysis and updating estimates regularly. They also suggest increasing the technical skills of local teams and leveraging international expertise more effectively.

**7. Limitations of the Study:**
- The small sample size of just five countries limits the generalizability of findings.
- Political climates in LLMICs present constraints on data availability and sensitivity.
- The reliance on self-reported data may not reflect a country's official stance or complete reality.

Overall, the study underscores significant challenges in the costing of EPHS in LLMICs, particularly in terms of methodological consistency, data availability, and integration into national budgeting processes. It emphasizes the importance of sustained capacity building and cross-country learning to enhance the utility and accuracy of costing exercises in achieving UHC.","As countries progress towards universal health coverage (UHC), they frequently develop explicit packages of health services compatible with UHC goals. As part of the Disease Control Initiative 3 Country Translation project, a systematic survey instrument was developed and used to review the experience of five low-income and lower-middle-income countries—Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Somalia and Sudan—in estimating the cost of their proposed packages. The paper highlights the main results of the survey, providing information about how costing exercises were conducted and used and what country teams perceived to be the main challenges. Key messages are identified to facilitate similar exercises and improve their usefulness. Critical challenges to be addressed include inconsistent application of costing methods, measurement errors and data reliability issues, the lack of adequate capacity building, and the lack of integration between costing and budgeting. The paper formulates four recommendations to address these challenges: (1) developing more systematic guidance and standard ways to implement costing methodologies, particularly regarding the treatment of health systems-related common costs, (2) acknowledging ranges of uncertainty of costing results and integrating sensitivity analysis, (3) building long-term capacity at the local level and institutionalising the costing process in order to improve both reliability and policy relevance, and (4) closely linking costing exercises to public budgeting."
The role of the private sector in delivering essential packages of health services: Lessons from country experiences,"Sameen Siddiqi, Wafa Aftab, A Venkat Raman, Agnès Soucat, Ala Alwan",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2022-010742,2023-1-19,['The Aga Khan University'],Review,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Governance']","['Universal Health Coverage', 'Public-Private Partnerships', 'Policy Reform']",,"### Summary of the Article on Private Sector Role in Health Services in Low-Income and Middle-Income Countries

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   - The article examines the critical role of the private health sector (PHS) in low-income and middle-income countries (LLMICs) where it provides a substantial portion of essential health services. The political backdrop includes the push towards universal health coverage (UHC) as a health target in the Sustainable Development Goals.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions:**
   - The research seeks to understand how the PHS can be effectively involved in implementing essential packages of health services (EPHS) to achieve UHC. It addresses human rights questions related to equitable access to healthcare services, financial protection for vulnerable populations, and quality of care.

3. **Research Methods:**
   - The study involved reviewing existing literature and country experiences with PHS in implementing EPHS. Electronic searches were conducted in databases like Medline and Google Scholar to gather relevant publications, focusing on the role of the private sector in health service delivery.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - The PHS is diverse, ranging from small unlicensed providers to large hospitals, posing challenges in governance, regulation, and alignment with public health goals. Countries like Afghanistan and Cambodia have used public-private partnerships (PPPs) to involve NGOs in delivering EPHS. However, issues of sustainability, governance, and equitable access persist.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   - Most countries have policy frameworks for PPPs, but these often fall short of including the PHS in EPHS delivery effectively. Regulatory environments are typically weak, and the quality and consistency of private sector involvement vary widely across countries.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - For effective EPHS implementation, the PHS must be strategically engaged, considering governance, quality, and equity challenges. The article suggests developing frameworks to understand PHS characteristics, enhancing regulatory controls, and increasing public investment in health systems as necessary steps. Further research is suggested to create adaptable guides for PHS engagement in health service delivery.

7. **Limitations:**
   - Political instability, underinvestment, and reliance on foreign aid in some countries pose significant challenges to sustainable private sector engagement. The study also highlights a lack of comprehensive data on PHS contributions and the impact of health reforms on financial protection and equitable access.

The article emphasizes the inevitable need for PHS involvement in achieving UHC while addressing the systemic challenges that can impede this goal.","Many countries are adopting essential packages of health services (EPHS) to implement universal health coverage (UHC), which are mostly financed and delivered by the public sector, while the potential role of the private health sector (PHS) remains untapped. Currently, many low-income and lower middle-income countries (LLMICs) have devised EPHS; however, guidance on translating these packages into quality, accessible and affordable services is limited. This paper explores the role of PHS in achieving UHC, identifies key concerns and presents the experience of the Diseases Control Priorities 3 Country Translation project in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan and Zanzibar. There are key challenges to engagement of the PHS, which include the complexity and heterogeneity of private providers, their operation in isolation of the health system, limitations of population coverage and equity when left to PHS’s own choices, and higher overall cost of care for privately delivered services. Irrespective of the strategies employed to involve the PHS in delivering EPHS, it is necessary to identify private providers in terms of their characteristics and contribution, and their response to regulatory tools and incentives. Strategies for regulating private providers include better statutory control to prevent unlicensed practice, self-regulation by professional bodies to maintain standards of practice and accreditation of large private hospitals and chains. Potentially, purchasing delivery of essential services by engaging private providers can be an effective ‘regulatory approach’ to modify provider behaviour. Despite existing experience, more research is needed to better explore and operationalise the role of PHS in implementing EPHS in LLMICs."

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   The article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Afghanistan's health system, which has faced additional disruptions due to political upheaval and regime change following the Taliban's takeover in August 2021. The pandemic strained health systems globally, and Afghanistan's situation was compounded by nearly 40 years of conflict, poverty, and other socio-political challenges.

2. **Research Purpose and Human Rights Questions:**
   The research aimed to evaluate changes in essential health services in Afghanistan following the third wave of COVID-19 infections, focusing on the backlog generated during the pandemic and the political changes affecting health service delivery. The study addresses the challenge of maintaining essential health services amidst these disruptions.

3. **Research Methods:**
   A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a WHO standardized assessment tool, targeting 92 health facilities in five Afghan provinces. The study used a multi-stage sampling approach, collecting data in early 2022 by interviewing facility managers from non-COVID designated health centers.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - An increase in outpatient care, particularly maternal and child health services.
   - Increased service utilization for tuberculosis, chronic respiratory diseases, mental health, and substance abuse.
   - Decreased services for malaria, neglected tropical diseases, and community outreach programs.
   - A significant lack of training on COVID-19 protocols for healthcare staff, with only 65.2% referring COVID-19 patients to designated hospitals and 44.6% having safe transport for these patients.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   The research touches upon the existing healthcare policies set by the Afghan Ministry of Public Health, emphasizing the need for improvement in COVID-19 management strategies, such as proper referrals and training.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The study highlights the need to integrate COVID-19 management into routine healthcare services at all levels and calls for strengthening the healthcare system's capacity to maintain essential services, particularly under dual burdens of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Recommendations include mapping resources, enhancing workforce skills, and developing robust emergency management plans within the healthcare system.

7. **Limitations:**
   Limitations include reliance on self-reported data from facilities, lack of access to private sector data, and political instability affecting data reliability and facility operations. The study was confined to more populated provinces, possibly overlooking the broader picture in less supported regions.

Overall, the study provides critical insights into the strain on health services in an already vulnerable setting, advocating for strategic interventions to ensure continuous delivery of essential health services amid pandemics and political instability.","IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted provision of essential health services and overwhelmed even robust health systems worldwide. The Afghanistan health system has suffered both from the pandemic, as well as from political upheaval and regime change.MethodsWe evaluated essential service delivery using data collected from a cross-sectional survey of health care facilities in Afghanistan based on administration of a World Health Organization standardized assessment of frontline service readiness. A multi-stage sampling scheme was used to identify a representative sample of 92 health facilities (68 clinics and 24 hospitals) providing essential health services in five provinces. Facility managers were asked to report on changes in health service delivery in late 2021 and early 2022 (corresponding to the end of a significant national COVID-19 surge in infections) compared to the same period one year earlier.ResultsAmong health facilities evaluated; 29 were in urban and 63 were in rural settings. Most facilities reported an increase in the provision of outpatient care particularly in maternal and child health services as well as for tuberculosis, chronic respiratory diseases, mental health, and substance abuse; the number of in-patients also increased. In contrast, provision of services for malaria, neglected tropical diseases, and community outreach programs decreased. Nearly all facilities used strategies to maintain services, including targeting high-risk patients, promoting self-care, and redirecting patients to alternative health care sites. Nearly three fourth (70.6%) of facilities provided no training about COVID-19 to staff; only 65.2% referred COVID-19 patients to designated hospitals and 44.6% had safe transportation for these patients.DiscussionIncreased demand for services during this period was likely due to a backlog in need generated during the preceding COVID-19 surge and the political changes happened a few months earlier to this survey. Facilities used various methods to maintain services, although the decrease in provision of community outreach was concerning. Facilities appeared to be able to maintain essential health services, despite an increase in demand. However, awareness and training of COVID-19 protocols and appropriate and safe referrals need to be improved. In general, these series of surveys are informative and helpful to identify any changes in provision of essential health services and can facilitate recovery of health systems during and after pandemics."

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   Historically, transgenerational relationships between older men and younger males, particularly beardless youth known as ""bachah,"" have been a recognized social phenomenon in Afghanistan, even as such practices waned in other Islamic societies due to colonial influences and modernization. The tradition endured in Afghanistan amidst various socio-political tides, including the rise and fall of the Afghan kingdom and various regimes.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions:**
   The article explores the historical and cultural significance of bachah relationships in Afghanistan, examining how these relationships have been shaped by socio-political factors over centuries. It seeks to explore meanings attached to the bachah figure and scrutinizes how these relationships interact with discourses on human rights, especially considering recent international condemnations of bachah-bāzi (liaising with bachahs) as a human rights issue.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The research draws from both primary and secondary sources, including historical texts and fieldwork conducted in Afghanistan from 2016 to 2021. The method involves a historical analysis illustrated with firsthand stories gathered during fieldwork.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The study highlights the ever-changing perception and significance of bachah in Afghan society, noting both erotic and non-erotic aspects of man-bachah relationships. Key findings include the historical presence of bachahs in various social and political settings, the evolution of legal and moral perceptions, and violations like forced conscription and abuse during war, especially highlighted in the 1980s and 1990s.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   Historically, legal responses to bachah-bāzi varied, such as Amir ʿAbdur Rahman Khan's policies during the late nineteenth century and more recent Penal Codes addressing gender and sexual interaction. Taliban decrees in the 1990s further illustrate a distinct legal and moral approach to regulating interactions with beardless youth.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The article suggests that modern understandings of bachah, viewed through the lens of children's rights and international law, diverge significantly from historical perspectives and practices. It calls for deeper understanding and contextualization when addressing man-bachah relationships, rather than imposing Westernized moral evaluations.

7. **Study Limitations:**
   Limitations include the sensitivity of the topic, the lack of comprehensive data due to political instability, and the influence of contemporary Western narratives, which may convolute understanding of the practice's historical and cultural contexts.

Overall, the article underscores the complexity of man-bachah relationships within Afghan culture and history, and the shifts in understanding these relationships through both local and international lenses.","AbstractAfghanistan is one of the few places where the category ofbachah—the beardless young male—has maintained its aesthetic and erotic aspects in the public imagination. This article provides an introduction to the history of the various arrangements of man-bachahrelationships in Afghanistan from the rise of the Afghan kingdom in the late eighteenth century. By looking at both primary and secondary sources, alongside ethnographic materials gathered during fieldwork in Afghanistan between 2016 and 2021, this article shows how the content and implications of the category ofbachahhave been in constant flux and intimately connected to wider social, political, and economic developments both inside the country and beyond."
Chaos and Humanitarian Interventions in Afghanistan: Through a Kantian Lens,"Wagisha, Shalini Singh, Abhilash Arun Sapre, Shaeyuq Ahmad Shah, Ashutosh Ranjan Srivastava",https://doi.org/10.15332/19090528.9728,2023-6-15,['North-Eastern Hill University'],Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"With the Taliban’s resurgence in Afghanistan, a unique situation arises regarding their pursuit of international recognition. On the one hand, their close ties to terrorist organisations like al-Qaeda and their questionable sources of funding raise significant concerns about the consequences of granting them international legitimacy. Conversely, the international community, particularly the United States, appears hesitant to intervene at this juncture, prompting thoughtful reflection. Specifically, post-recognition, there is a looming question about whether the Taliban will persist in endorsing terrorist activities or relying on illicit funding methods. In such a scenario, determining the justification for humanitarian interventions becomes a critical consideration. Moreover, the extent of intervention during the transitional phase from lawlessness to lawfulness in Afghanistan, where extreme crimes are prevalent, demands scrutiny. In this context, it is pertinent to explore Immanuel Kant’s perspectives on humanity and his work Perpetual Peace as they align with the current situation. Therefore, this paper aims to assess both sides of the issue through a Kantian lens to gauge the appropriateness of humanitarian intervention under these unique circumstances. Ultimately, this analysis could shape a new framework for interventions in dire situations involving “crimes against humanity” or threats to human lives stemming from such conditions."

The historical sociology of international relations makes it possible to assess the influence of the past on the essence of the social groups’ decisions, and to consider their attempts to construct outer threats for domestic purposes. The concept of “Strategic Depth” could be divided into three aspects: the demarcation and delimitation of the Pakistani-Afghan border, control over the Frontier area in Pakistan, and the possible usage of instability in these territories by other countries. None of “Strategic Depth”’s aims has ever been achieved after the Taliban takeover. The Taliban government in Kabul is not ready to recognize the Durand line, the confrontation between the TTP and the Centre has only escalated, New Delhi and Kabul are resuming their dialogue. The Pakistani military elites equally perceive the threats from India and Afghanistan, which allows them to justify their special mission to repel external threats and preserve statehood. It can be assumed that the whole range of problems will remain on the agenda in the long term, since the domestic dimension of “Strategic Depth” is of greater importance than the foreign and strategic one.  "

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The study is set against the backdrop of Afghanistan's challenging healthcare system, impacted by years of conflict and instability. This has created barriers to accessing healthcare, particularly for mothers and children.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research aims to identify predictors of care-seeking behavior among Afghan mothers for their children suffering from common illnesses. It addresses challenges related to healthcare utilization, which is crucial for improving child health and reducing childhood morbidity and mortality in Afghanistan.

3. **Research Methods**: The study utilizes a cross-sectional design, analyzing data from the Afghanistan Health Survey (AHS) 2015. It focuses on women who reported their children experiencing symptoms like fever, cough, faster breathing, or diarrhea in the past two weeks. Andersen’s healthcare seeking behavior model was applied, and multinomial regression analysis was used to identify predictors of healthcare-seeking behaviors.

4. **Main Findings**: The study found that 39% of mothers sought healthcare for their sick children. Key predictors of care-seeking behavior included the mother's age, child's age and sex, socioeconomic status, the perceived severity of illness, and the number of children under five in the household. Notably, older children and girls were less likely to receive healthcare. Mothers who recognized symptoms of illness and older mothers were more likely to seek care.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The study does not explicitly examine Afghanistan’s legal frameworks but highlights systemic issues in healthcare access that may be influenced by broader policy and societal factors.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors recommend that policymakers use these findings to develop interventions, focusing on enhancing mothers’ knowledge about symptoms of childhood illnesses. This could promote timely healthcare-seeking behavior and improve treatment rates for preventable childhood diseases.

7. **Limitations**: The study acknowledges limitations related to potential biases in self-reported data and the cross-sectional nature of the study, which limits causality inference. The political climate and ongoing conflict in Afghanistan could also affect data collection and generalizability of findings across different regions of the country.","Background: Mothers’ care seeking behavior for childhood illness is a key factor of utilizing healthcare for children. We examined predictors of mothers’ care seeking for common childhood illnesses. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, using data from the Afghanistan Health Survey (AHS) 2015. Data were used from women who sought healthcare for their unwell children. The women were asked whether their children were sick with fever, cough, faster breathing, or diarrhea in the past 2 weeks. The outcome variable was defined as whether the mother sought healthcare for her unwell child from a public clinic, a private clinic, or from a pharmacy store. The Andersen’s healthcare seeking behavior model was used and multinomial regression analysis applied. Results: There were 4979 women, aged 15-49 years, whose under-5 children were sick in the past 2 weeks. Thirty-nine percent of women sought healthcare for their children from a health provider. Mother’s age, child’s age, child’s sex, socioeconomic status, mothers’ perceived severity of childhood illness, and number of under-5 children were predictors of mothers’ care seeking behavior. The likelihood of healthcare seeking was lower for older children (Adjusted odds ratio [OR] [95% CI]: 0.51 [0.37-0.70] from public clinics; 0.33 [0.23-0.47] from private clinics; 0.36 [0.22-0.61] from pharmacy stores), and for girls (Adjusted OR [95% CI]: 0.74 [0.59-0.93] from private clinics). The likelihood of healthcare seeking was greater for children whose mothers knew symptoms of childhood illness (Adjusted OR [95% CI]: 2.97 [1.44-6.16] from public clinics; 7.20 [3.04-17.04] from pharmacy stores). The likelihood of healthcare seeking for children was greater in older mothers (Adjusted OR [95% CI]: 1.54 [1.11-2.12]). It was less likely for the mothers who have more children to seek healthcare for their children (Adjusted OR [95% CI]: 0.53 [0.43-0.65] from public clinics; 0.61 [0.48- 0.79] from private clinics; 0.51 [0.37-0.69] from pharmacy stores). Conclusion: Health policy-makers may opt to use our findings, particularly mothers’ knowledge (perceived severity) of symptoms of childhood illness to develop interventions to enhance timely assessment and effective treatment of common preventable childhood illnesses."

Here’s a summary of the main points:

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context**: Afghanistan has endured a 40-year conflict along with political upheavals, including the 2021 government collapse, sanctions, and economic struggles. These factors have taken a heavy toll on the country’s healthcare system, leaving the population vulnerable to health risks due to limited access to healthcare and basic human rights.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The research seeks to identify and address the significant challenges faced in the Afghan healthcare system, including deficiencies in healthcare research. It focuses on health-related human rights, emphasizing the need for improved healthcare services, access, and equitable treatment in a fragile socio-political environment.

3. **Research Methods**: The article reviews existing literature and data related to Afghanistan's healthcare system, focusing on gaps and the current status of health research infrastructure and capacity.

4. **Main Findings**: Large gaps exist in access, coverage, and quality of healthcare services in Afghanistan. Health research is severely underdeveloped due to lack of institutions, trained researchers, and financial resources. The collapse of the government in 2021 exacerbated these issues, leading to a significant brain drain of health researchers. Research activities are mostly limited to urban areas, neglecting rural populations which face additional challenges like travel restrictions.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The Afghan Ministry of Public Health established an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for health research in 2005. However, only a few IRBs are functional primarily in urban areas, with limited regulatory and ethical support, especially in remote regions.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors recommend developing and enforcing standards and guidelines for transparent health research processes. Security for researchers is emphasized, along with the need for revised research policies and international collaboration. They call for increased funding and better training for researchers, alongside the use of technology-based research tools. The importance of financial support for publication processes is also noted.

7. **Limitations**: The study is limited by Afghanistan’s current political climate, which affects data availability and research sensitivity. Lack of access to technology and trained researchers further hampers health research progress, alongside financial constraints. 

Overall, significant growth is needed in Afghanistan’s health research sector to meet international standards, with a strong focus on collaboration, resource allocation, and capacity building.",No abstract available

1. **Overview and Context**: 
   - Approximately 900,000 newborns die annually in South Asia, accounting for nearly 40% of global neonatal deaths. Breastfeeding is crucial for child survival and development, but aggressive marketing of commercial milk formula (CMF) disrupts it. The WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (the Code) was introduced in 1981 to mitigate issues caused by CMF marketing. Seven out of eight South Asian countries have adopted some form of the Code.

2. **Purpose and Objectives**:
   - The study assesses the implementation status of the Code in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. It specifically explores the sales trends of CMF in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, examining gaps between national legal measures and the Code, and analyses trends in CMF sales and its impact on breastfeeding.

3. **Research Methods**:
   - The study utilizes descriptive analytical methods, including a desk review of the 2022 WHO/UNICEF/IBFAN Code Status Report, content analysis of national Code measures, and a regional workshop discussion. Data on sales and volume of CMF from 2007 to 2021, with predictions to 2026, were sourced from Global Data.

4. **Main Findings**:
   - Despite legal measures, gaps persist in Code implementation, such as insufficient conflict of interest safeguards and monitoring. The sales volume of CMF is high in health facilities and pharmacies. GUM and baby cereals dominate CMF sales in Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka. Sales trends also indicate an increase in per capita consumption of CMF, particularly in India.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**:
   - The study reviews each country’s legal framework for Code implementation and finds that most national laws partially align with the Code; notable deficits include inadequate age coverage of CMF, lack of explicit restrictions on digital marketing, and loopholes in safeguarding conflicts of interest. 

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**:
   - The authors conclude that critical steps include closing gaps in national measures, strengthening enforcement, safeguarding conflicts of interest, and tackling digital marketing. Political and jurist network support is crucial for effective Code implementation. They emphasize comprehensive monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, recommending clear laws that address current marketing challenges.

7. **Limitations**:
   - The study notes limitations such as challenges in directly associating Code implementation with sales trends due to other influencing factors, including marketing expenditure by CMF companies and other socio-economic variables. Additionally, lack of effective monitoring and data limitations in certain countries present a challenge. 

The research highlights the discrepancy between policy and practice in protecting breastfeeding in South Asia, while offering insights into improving legal regulations and enforcement to safeguard infant health.","ObjectivesThis study examines the status of implementation of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes of eight countries in the South Asia region (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka), and describes the sales value and volume of commercial milk formula (CMF) marketed as breastmilk substitutes (BMS) and baby food in four countries (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka).DesignA mix of descriptive methods is used to assess national status of Code implementation, including a desk review of the 2022 WHO/UNICEF/IBFAN Code Status Report, systematic content analysis of national Code measures, and insights generated from the participation of key government and UNICEF/WHO actors in a regional workshop that aimed to identify each country’s barriers, gaps, and the status of Code implementation. Data on the sales value and volume of CMF and baby food between 2007 to 2021 and with the prediction to 2026 in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka were obtained from Global Data.FindingsThere are major gaps in Code implementation in countries even with legal measures considered substantially aligned with the Code, such as the inadequate age range of CMF covered in the scope, insufficient safeguards against conflicts of interest in the health system, lack of warning of risks of intrinsic contamination of powdered milk formula, and an absence of effective monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. Data on CMF sales shows health facilities and pharmacies sustain the highest sales. Lower sales volume of infant formula (including special formula), compared to other CMF such as follow-up formula and growing-up milk, has been observed in three of the four countries (Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka). Overall, GUM, followed by baby cereals, accounted for a large portion of CMF and baby foods sales in the same three countries.Recommended actions include(1) Closing the gaps between national measures and the Code, (2) Ensuring effective monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, (3) Strengthening conflicts of interest safeguards in the health system, (4) Tackling digital marketing, and (5) Galvanizing political support and support from in-country public health and women’s rights jurist networks."

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   Afghanistan has experienced continuous conflict for over 20 years, severely impacting social services such as healthcare and education. The country's mountainous terrain and environmental challenges, coupled with sociopolitical instability, have further complicated the delivery of basic services, including health care.

2. **Research Purpose and Human Rights Challenges:**
   The article examines gaps in Afghanistan's healthcare delivery, specifically identifying underserved populations in rural areas where primary health services are inaccessible. The research addresses human rights issues related to the right to health, especially in light of inadequate health service coverage.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study employs a Geographic Information System (GIS) approach to analyze data from several public datasets. This method identifies underserved areas by mapping relationships between population centers, topographical challenges, and health facility locations. The GIS tool, AccessMod, models physical accessibility to healthcare facilities.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The research finds that over 9.5 million Afghans in 22,181 villages lack access to primary health services, as these services are not reachable within an hour's walking distance. These underserved areas highlight inadequacies in health service coverage due to geographical and infrastructural barriers.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   While the article does not delve deeply into specific legal frameworks, it implies that existing policies and infrastructure are insufficient to meet the health needs of Afghanistan's diverse and scattered populations.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that substantial improvements in healthcare are needed in Afghanistan. They recommend leveraging the GIS model findings to improve service provision and ensure access to healthcare for remote populations. The establishment of an online health information portal is suggested to facilitate stakeholder access and action.

7. **Study Limitations:**
   The study acknowledges limitations such as outdated population data due to the lack of a national census since 1979, and discrepancies in health facility data due to self-reporting. These data challenges are exacerbated by Afghanistan's ongoing conflict and political instability, affecting data collection and validation.

The article underlines the crucial need for precise data and strategic interventions in addressing health service delivery challenges as a fundamental human right in Afghanistan.","Afghanistan has been in an active state of conflict and war for twenty continuous years. Social services like health and education have been badly affected, facing issues such as service disruption, brain drain, and generalized instability. Health indices that provide proxy indicators for general population wellness, such as maternal health, child mortality, and immunization coverage, show that the health services available to the Afghan population are sub-optimal. Investment in social service and interventions has increased. The World Bank and the United Nations through its agencies (The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations' Children's Fund (UNICEF) are providing social support through targeted and strategic programs. However, the topographic and environmental realities of Afghanistan, with its broad mountain coverage, propensity toward natural disasters, and latent conflict, has made data and information gathering arduous. Since data is essential for measurement and management, the WHO Health Emergencies (WHE) information management unit at WHO Afghanistan has delivered an innovative form of data analysis, specialized and targeted at providing improved information on communities that are not adequately covered by health services. Deploying a geographical information system (GIS) approach, the WHE team has collated primary and secondary data from a combination of datasets to produce a far-reaching piece of analysis. The analysis of underserved communities in hard to reach, remote locations, provides a live, evidence-based information product. This provides a working tool that is essential to primary health programming and intervention in Afghanistan. The estimates show that approximately 9.5 million individuals in 22,181 villages across 34 provinces are underserved by primary health services. This paper is presented to explain the underpinning methodology."

Makoveeva,https://doi.org/10.24833/2071-8160-2023-4-91-56-71,2023-9-19,['University of Jinan'],Article,1,Yes,"['Security and Conflict', 'Economy and Infrastructure']","['Military Actions', 'International Investment']",,"**Summary:**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The article discusses the conclusion of the U.S.'s twenty-year military involvement in Afghanistan, marked by the Taliban's takeover after the U.S.-backed Afghan government failed to maintain power. This shift has stirred uncertainty in Afghanistan's domestic and international affairs. Neighboring countries, particularly China and Russia, have shown varied responses, with China engaging economically under its Belt and Road Initiative and Russia leveraging historical ties with Afghanistan.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research aims to analyze the shifts in U.S. strategy and policy towards Afghanistan following the military withdrawal in August 2021. It addresses the human rights challenges and questions arising from the changed geopolitical dynamics and security risks in Central Asia.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The article employs an analytical approach to evaluate the geopolitical implications of the U.S. troop withdrawal, assessing strategic interests and the regional security landscape post-withdrawal.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The U.S. withdrawal has altered the balance of power in Central Asia. This creates new international security risks but also opportunities for countries interested in engaging with a Taliban-led Afghanistan. The Taliban are showing interest in economic cooperation with foreign companies to maintain peace and stability, as evidenced by diplomatic interactions with neighboring states.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   The article briefly mentions the U.S.'s need to reconfigure its security strategy concerning Afghanistan, suggesting an examination of U.S. legal and policy adaptations in light of the new power dynamics in the region.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that the rapidly evolving situation in Afghanistan necessitates close monitoring of political shifts by both the Taliban government and U.S. policy adjustments. They imply that strategic and diplomatic efforts should prioritize stability and peace in the region.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The study's limitations include the dynamic political climate in Afghanistan, unpredictable long-term developments, and the sensitivity of human rights concerns under Taliban rule, making it challenging to formulate solid predictions or comprehensive policies. Additionally, the focus on Ukraine has diverted significant international attention away from Afghanistan.","The withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in the middle of 2021 has put at stake and turned to shock the world community. The world, which was fighting COVID-19, faced more concerns about the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. It became not only a concern of Middle East countries, but it raised questions in Europe too. While the Middle East countries were anxious about security issues in the region, Europe was anxious about the mass migration of refugees. Russia, the country which is crucially interested in stable peace in the Middle East, and China, which is cooperating with Afghanistan in the economic sector, began negotiations with the Taliban government to stabilize the situation peacefully after the withdrawal of American troops.The article analyzes the changes in US policy in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of troops in August 2021. The withdrawal of the US military contingent from Afghanistan has changed the balance of power in Central Asia, which, on the one hand, creates new risks to international security, and on the other hand, opens up new opportunities for interested players in the international arena in the region. In the new conditions, the United States is forced to restructure its policy towards Afghanistan and change its security strategy in accordance with the new balance of forces in the region. The findings of the study relate to the actual interests of the United States in the field of security in Afghanistan and in the Central Asian region as a whole."
Validation of the Farsi version of the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Scale,"Ali Mehrabi, Azam Naghavi, Mohammad Ershad Afsharzada, Sören Friedrich, Thomas Forkmann, Heide Glaesmer, Tobias Teismann",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1201193,2023-9-6,['University of Isfahan'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Education']","['Mental Health', 'Gender']",,"**Summary of the Article**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**  
   The article highlights the prevalence of suicide ideation and behavior among Farsi-speaking populations, notably in countries like Iran and Afghanistan, and among migrants from these regions. In Afghanistan, the political climate, especially after the Taliban takeover, has exacerbated mental health issues such as depression and suicidality, particularly among students.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**  
   The research aimed to validate the Farsi version of the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Scale (SIBS). This study focused on providing a reliable and valid tool to assess current suicidal ideation and behavior among Farsi-speaking populations, addressing a significant gap in mental health resources in these regions.

3. **Research Methods:**  
   The research involved 279 Afghan university students to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Farsi version of SIBS. Reliability and validity were tested through internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity, and confirmatory factor analysis. The participants provided data via a voluntary, online survey, which included SIBS among other psychological measures.

4. **Main Findings:**  
   The study confirmed the Farsi SIBS’s unidimensionality and excellent internal consistency, making it a reliable measure for assessing suicidal ideation. High correlations were found between SIBS scores and depression, PTSD, and other suicide ideation metrics, while it correlated negatively with positive mental health indicators.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**  
   Although the study doesn't deeply explore legal frameworks, it touches on the broader context of Afghanistan, highlighting limitations in mental health resources, partly due to political instability and societal challenges, which complicate the implementation of mental health assessments and treatments.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**  
   The authors conclude that the Farsi version of SIBS is effective for research and clinical assessments in the region. They recommend its use alongside other tools like the SBQ-R to cover broader timeframes of suicidality. They emphasize the necessity of emergency contact provision when conducting such sensitive research, especially in resource-limited settings like Afghanistan.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**  
   Limitations include the homogeneity of the sample (Afghan students), which may not represent the wider Farsi-speaking or clinical populations. The study does not measure test-retest reliability, and it's limited by its cross-sectional nature and reliance on self-report measures. Politically, the study faces challenges due to the harsh realities in Afghanistan, notably after the Taliban’s educational restrictions on women, affecting future research opportunities. The data’s generalizability is also restricted by linguistic considerations, as only Persian-speaking Farsi populations can currently utilize the questionnaire.","ObjectiveSuicide ideation and suicide attempts are prevalent in Farsi speaking populations. The present study aimed at validating the Farsi version of the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Scale (SIBS).MethodsReliability and validity of the Farsi version of the SIBS were established in a highly burdened Afghan student sample (N = 279). Internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity were investigated, and confirmatory factor analysis was conducted.ResultsThe Farsi version of the SIBS was shown to have a unidimensional structure with excellent internal consistency, as well as good convergent and divergent validity.DiscussionThe results suggest that the SIBS is a brief, reliable, and valid measure of current suicidal ideation and behavior that can be used in Farsi speaking populations."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Afghanistan has experienced persistent conflict and socio-economic challenges, particularly intensifying after the Taliban regained control in August 2021. This has greatly impacted child-rearing practices and the socio-political environment in which families operate. Afghanistan's culture is deeply rooted in collectivist values, as Islamic and social norms shape family structures and gender roles, often reinforced by economic and political dependencies.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The study aimed to develop and refine the Thrive by Five app, a child-rearing tool tailored for Afghan parents and caregivers. It addresses gaps in accessible, culturally relevant parenting information to support children's social, emotional, and cognitive development, targeting challenges brought about by Afghanistan's ongoing conflict and restrictive environment, especially for women.

3. **Research Methods**: An iterative co-design approach was employed, involving eight workshops with Afghan parents, caregivers, and subject matter experts (SMEs). Feedback from participants was used to tailor content to sociocultural realities, and thematic analysis was applied to inform content refinement and development.

4. **Main Findings**: Central themes included the sociocultural context of Afghan child-rearing, safety concerns, emotion and behavior management, and physical health and nutrition. Adaptations involved promoting indoor activities due to security issues, removing music-related content outside the home due to restrictions, and engaging extended families in child-rearing. The findings revealed increased screen time for children and a need for mental support strategies for parents amidst the volatile situation.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The study noted the Taliban's restrictive policies, particularly impacting women's freedoms and access to education and employment, creating barriers for holistic child development through formal education systems.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The study emphasizes the significance of culturally contextualized interventions in digital health solutions for marginalized groups. Recommendations include adapting child-rearing content to ensure safety within conflict settings, promoting extended family involvement, providing alternatives to screen time, and fostering self-confidence and empathy in children. Technology can offer vital support and empowerment for Afghan parents under these constraints.

7. **Limitations**: Limitations include non-representative sampling due to Afghanistan's instability, connectivity issues preventing app testing by some participants, and the lack of immersive fieldwork. These factors constrain the generalizability of findings across Afghanistan’s diverse sociocultural landscape.","BackgroundOptimal child-rearing practices can help mitigate the consequences of detrimental social determinants of health in early childhood. Given the ubiquity of personal digital technologies worldwide, the direct delivery of evidence-based information about early childhood development holds great promise. However, to make the content of these novel systems effective, it is crucial to incorporate place-based cultural beliefs, traditions, circumstances, and value systems of end users.ObjectiveThis paper describes the iterative approach used to develop the Thrive by Five child-rearing app in collaboration with Afghan parents, caregivers (eg, grandparents, aunts, and nannies), and subject matter experts (SMEs). We outline how co-design methodologies informed the development and cultural contextualization of content to meet the specific needs of Afghan parents and the content was tested and refined in collaboration with key Afghan stakeholders.MethodsThe preliminary content was developed based on a comprehensive literature review of the historical and sociocultural contexts in Afghanistan, including factors that influence child-rearing practices and early childhood development. After an initial review and refinement based on feedback from SMEs, this content was populated into a beta app for testing. Overall, 8 co-design workshops were conducted in July and August 2021 and February 2022 with 39 Afghan parents and caregivers and 6 SMEs to collect their feedback on the app and its content. The workshops were audio recorded and transcribed; detailed field notes were taken by 2 scribes. A theoretical thematic analysis using semantic codes was conducted to inform the refinement of existing content and development of new content to fulfill the needs identified by participants.ResultsThe following 4 primary themes were identified: child-rearing in the Afghan sociocultural context, safety concerns, emotion and behavior management, and physical health and nutrition. Overall, participants agreed that the app had the potential to deliver valuable information to Afghan parents; however, owing to the volatility in the country, participants recommended including more activities that could be safely done indoors, as mothers and children are required to spend most of their time at home. Additionally, restrictions on public engagement in music required the removal of activities referencing singing that might be performed outside the home. Further, activities to help parents reduce their children’s screen time, promote empathy, manage emotions, regulate behavior, and improve physical health and nutrition were requested.ConclusionsDirect engagement with Afghan parents, caregivers, and SMEs through co-design workshops enabled the development and refinement of evidence-based, localized, and contextually relevant child-rearing activities promoting healthy social, emotional, and cognitive development during the first 5 years of children’s lives. Importantly, the content was adapted for the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan with the aim of empowering Afghan parents and caregivers to support their children’s developmental potential despite the security concerns and situational stressors."

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context**: In many low- and middle-income countries, cultural taboos and misconceptions around menstruation remain prevalent, leading to inadequate preparation and support for menstruating individuals. Globally, this results in widespread health and hygiene challenges.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The research aims to address gaps in menstrual health education, particularly the lack of awareness and prevalence of misconceptions among women and girls. It seeks to highlight and tackle the issue of menstrual hygiene management as a crucial aspect of women's health rights.

3. **Research Methods**: This study utilized a descriptive cross-sectional methodology, employing quota sampling among 346 female students at Kabul University of Medical Sciences. The research involved a structured questionnaire to assess demographic data, menstrual knowledge, beliefs, and hygiene practices.

4. **Main Findings**: The study found that a majority of respondents (77.6%) had regular menstrual cycles, though many experienced painful menstruation. Despite 59.6% being aware of menstruation pre-menstruation, misconceptions persisted, particularly regarding diet and activities during menstruation. A large portion of this awareness came from mothers, despite their own limited knowledge. Overall, the students had good knowledge and practices but held weaker beliefs regarding menstruation.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies Examination**: The study does not explicitly examine the legal frameworks regarding menstruation in Afghanistan but highlights the lack of official statistics on menstrual health awareness from Afghanistan’s Ministry of Public Health.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors recommend enhancing education and information dissemination to mothers and females, emphasizing the need to combat cultural taboos and myths regarding menstruation. Improving health education in schools and empowering health workers to provide accurate information is also suggested.

7. **Limitations**: One key limitation is the restricted scope of the study, which is confined to female students in a single university, thus possibly limiting the findings' generalizability. The ongoing political and social challenges in Afghanistan also pose a barrier to broader study implementation and data accuracy.",No abstract available

The article focuses on reconstructing the major parameters of the complex of challenges and threats to post-Soviet Central Asia regional security that has emerged in the wake of or in direct connection with the radical change of the situation in Afghanistan after August 2021. These challenges and threats have developed across several functional and territorial dimensions and require a comprehensive analysis followed by the building of scenarios for their evolution.  Methods and materials. The research relies on the regional security complex theory developed by Barry Buzan and Ole Waever. The methodological toolkit includes external indirect observation, political descriptive and historical genetic methods, scenario building. The research materials include official statements, news briefs, expert opinions, periodicals, academic papers.  Analysis. The authors have analyzed the geostrategic, regional-strategic, regional-economic, and regional-societal dimensions of the challenges and threats to Central Asian regional security generated by the changes in Afghanistan and have built scenarios of their evolution. The major geostrategic challenge is the exacerbation of U.S. – Chinese contradictions centered on the influence of the Taliban factions. The key regional-strategic threat is the risk of the Afghan conflict spilling over into Tajikistan or Turkmenistan. The regional-economic challenges include the risks of blocking trans-Afghan transport, pipeline, and electricity transmission projects. The regional-societal risks consist of the dissemination of radical Islamist ideologies from Afghanistan throughout Central Asia. The two basic scenarios of the regional security evolution are inertia or a resumption of a full-scale civil war in Afghanistan.  Results. The authors have worked out sets of recommendations for regional policymakers and the intergovernmental bodies whose functions include maintaining security and stability in Central Asia. Authors’ contribution. A.E. Dzhorobekova has developed the general concept of the article and organized the research. E.F.

Penholding in the UN Security Council: A Window of Opportunity,"Jenny Nortvedt, Maria Gilen Røysamb",https://doi.org/10.23865/intpol.v81.5495,2023-8-1,['Norsk Utenrikspolitisk Institutt'],Review,1,Yes,"['Governance', 'Security and Conflict']","['International Community', 'Peace Initiatives']",,"1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The article examines Norway's role as an elected member of the UN Security Council from 2021-2022, focusing on its penholder role concerning Afghanistan. This period was marked by significant global events, including the Taliban's power takeover in Afghanistan in August 2021 and Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. These events influenced the international political landscape and discussions within the Security Council.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The research aims to explore the informal penholder system in the UN Security Council, specifically Norway's role in shaping international responses to the Afghan situation. It addresses challenges related to geopolitical conflicts and their implications for human rights, such as governance collapse and humanitarian crises in Afghanistan following the Taliban resurgence.

3. **Research Methods**: The authors conducted interviews with Norwegian diplomats and diplomats from other permanent and elected member countries of the UN Security Council. These interviews were combined with practice theory to analyze the influence and effectiveness of the penholder role.

4. **Main Findings**: The article finds that the penholder role is a powerful tool for elected members to exert influence over specific issues in the Security Council. Norway used this position to manage discussions and influence decisions regarding UNAMA's role and international statements on Afghanistan. However, a country's diplomatic influence in this role is dependent on its social and diplomatic capital.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The study touches on how the informal nature of the penholder role allows countries like Norway to push their policy priorities within the Security Council, potentially affecting the Council's legal and operational frameworks related to human rights protections in conflict zones like Afghanistan.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that penholding can be a significant mechanism for elected members to affect change and promote their priorities in the Security Council. They recommend leveraging diplomatic relationships and capital to maximize influence. The article suggests that more explicit guidelines or recognition of the penholder role might enhance its effectiveness and transparency.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study highlights the inherent limitations imposed by the UN Security Council's structure, where permanent members wield veto power, potentially overriding initiatives by elected members. Furthermore, sensitive geopolitical dynamics, such as conflicts involving major powers, can limit smaller countries' influence, and the availability of data is constrained by the confidential nature of diplomatic negotiations.","Som valgt medlem av FNs sikkerhetsråd i perioden 2021–2022 hadde Norge mulighet til å utgjøre en forskjell og yte innflytelse i verdens mektigste organ. I rollen som pennefører for Afghanistan gjorde Norge nettopp det. I løpet av medlemskapsperioden vedtok Sikkerhetsrådet å forlenge mandatet til FNs politiske oppdrag i Afghanistan (UNAMA), samt vedtok flere presseuttalelser og presidentuttalelser om situasjonen i Afghanistan. Bakteppet for den krevende jobben som pennefører var Talibans maktovertakelse i Afghanistan i august 2021 og Russlands angrepskrig mot Ukraina fra februar 2022. Med utgangspunkt i praksisteori og på bakgrunn av intervjuer med norske diplomater som forhandlet på vegne av Norge i FNs sikkerhetsråd, samt diplomater fra andre faste og valgte medlemsland, ser vi i denne artikkelen nærmere på den uformelle penneførerrollen i FNs sikkerhetsråd og Norges innsats som leder for arbeidet med Afghanistan. Artikkelen konkluderer med at penneførerrollen i FNs sikkerhetsråd er en av de sterkeste verktøyene for å oppnå innflytelse i enkeltsaker for valgte medlemsland, men er betinget av medlemslandenes diplomatiske kapital. Videre utgjør den uformelle praksisen også en mulighet til å fremme egne prioriteringer i Sikkerhetsrådet.
Abstract in English:Penholding in the UN Security Council: A Window of OpportunityAs an elected member of the UN Security Council between 2021 and 2022, Norway had the opportunity to achieve results within one of the world’s most powerful institutions. As a penholder on Afghanistan, Norway accomplished several important press statements, presidential statements and the 2022 extension of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). The context for this work was the seizure of power by the Taliban in Afghanistan in August 2021, and the invasion of Ukraine by the veto power Russia in February 2022. Based on interviews with Norwegian diplomats, and other elected and permanent members, this article investigates the informal penholder system in the UN Security Council. Furthermore, it looks into Norway’s role and experience as the penholder for Afghanistan. Practice theory brings insight to how an informal practice like penholding in the UN Security Council can provide influence for elected members if they know how to take advantage of this role. The article concludes that penholding is an important role for elected members in order to achieve influence in a specific case, but also to promote one’s own priority areas. However, influence through penholding is still conditioned by the country’s social capital, and goodwill from permanent members of the Security Council."
Physical Abuse Perpetrated by In-laws: An Analysis of Nationally Representative Survey Data from 47 Low- and Middle-income Countries,"Jacinta Mukulu Waila, Michael Lowery Wilson, Till Bärnighausen, Anne Abio",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10896-023-00620-9,2023-8-22,['Universität Heidelberg'],Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Culture, Society, and Heritage']","['Gender', 'Traditional Practices']",,"The article presents a study that explores domestic violence perpetrated by in-laws, focusing on both male and female victims, to broaden understanding within extended family contexts.

1. **Context**: Historically, most research on domestic violence centers on women as victims, largely neglecting male victims and violence by in-laws. The study analyzes data from multiple countries, which may have diverse social and cultural dynamics influencing violence prevalence.

2. **Purpose**: The study aims to quantify domestic violence by in-laws, a group often overlooked, and addresses the human rights challenge of accurately capturing and addressing domestic abuse in diverse family structures.

3. **Methods**: The research utilized nationally representative cross-sectional data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) across 47 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It estimated the prevalence of physical violence by in-laws.

4. **Findings**: Main findings indicate that violence by in-laws is prevalent but often under-reported. Mothers-in-law were identified as primary perpetrators against both genders, motivated by family dynamics and traditions. Contrary to previous studies, men reported higher exposure to physical violence by in-laws in some contexts. The East Mediterranean region showed high female-targeted violence, whereas Africa had high male-targeted violence, suggesting potential shifts in cultural norms and gender roles. 

5. **Legal Framework and Policies**: The study briefly explores how various cultural systems and family structures in different regions contribute to differences in domestic violence patterns. It highlights the need for policies that consider both male and female victims, especially in contexts with unique kinship structures.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that there is a critical need to address domestic violence by in-laws, with future research needed to understand the contextual nuances of such violence. They recommend a gender-inclusive approach in policies and interventions addressing domestic violence.

7. **Limitations**: Key limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the data, potential recall bias, under-reporting due to stigma, and the impact of COVID-19 restrictions, which may have skewed results. The study also recognizes a lack of comparable nationally representative studies to benchmark findings against.

Overall, the study sheds light on the complexities and prevalence of in-law violence, revealing it to be a significant, yet under-studied, component of domestic violence. It calls for further investigation and policy adjustments to address these challenges across different cultural and social landscapes.","Abstract
              Purpose
              Violence within extended kinship contexts remains understudied. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of physical violence perpetrated by in-laws.
            
              Methods
              Demographic and Health Surveys’ data collected between 2011 and 2020 were utilized. Data for females and males were derived from 47 and 10 countries respectively. We estimated the prevalence of being physically hurt by mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law and other in-laws against participating females (n=420 020) and males (n=71 629) separately.
            
              Results
              The pooled prevalence for in-law perpetrated physical violence against female respondents was 0.38% (95% CI 0.34, 0.42). The prevalence of violence from mothers-in-law was 0.18% (95% CI 0.15, 0.21), fathers-in-law was 0.11% (95% CI 0.09, 0.13) and other in-laws 0.20% (95% CI 0.17, 0.23). The pooled prevalence of in-law violence against male respondents was 0.56%; (95% CI 0.45, 0.71), and from mothers-in-law was 0.08%; (95% CI 0.05, 0.13), fathers-in-law was 0.05%; (95% CI 0.03, 0.09) and other in-laws was 0.51%; (95% CI 0.39, 0.66). Among individual countries, the highest prevalence among females and males was recorded in Afghanistan at 4.07% (95% CI 3.30, 5.02) and in Mozambique at 2.24%; (95% CI 1.56, 3.20) respectively.
            
              Conclusion
              Violence by in-laws affects both men and women in varying degrees across different countries. The data indicate that it is possible for one individual to experience violence perpetrated by more than one extended family member. Given the paucity of research in this area, it is hoped that the results may stimulate further inquiry into relevant contextual and social variables which influence in-law violence.

Intimate Partner Violence and Unmet Need for Family Planning in Selected South Asian Countries,"Keh Yoong Hoo, Siow Li Lai",https://doi.org/10.1177/00207314221131218,2022-10-9,['Universiti Malaya'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available," This article analyzes the relationship between various forms of intimate partner violence (IPV) and unmet need for family planning (FP) in South Asia. The data were obtained from the latest wave of the Demographic and Health Survey in Afghanistan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan. Binary logistic regression analyses show mixed results, with a significant association between at least one type of IPV and unmet need for FP in all countries under study, except Maldives. There were also contrasting findings on the IPV–unmet need nexus, with a positive sign in some but negative sign in others. Women who experienced physical violence were associated with a higher odds of having an unmet need in Pakistan, but the opposite was true in Afghanistan and Nepal. The odds of having an unmet need were higher among Indian women who experienced IPV (sexual and emotional). In Afghanistan, women who experienced IPV (physical and emotional) have lower odds of having an unmet need. However, the interaction analysis of IPV (physical and sexual) and partners’ controlling behavior showed a positive association with unmet need. Policymakers need to develop policies and strategies to prevent IPV and reduce unmet need for FP, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. "

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Afghanistan, a low- and middle-income country (LMIC), faces significant public health challenges. This context includes a high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension despite global advancements in its management. The socioeconomic conditions, healthcare accessibility, and ongoing political instability contribute to the inadequate control of hypertension and overall healthcare delivery.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The study aimed to determine the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension among patients receiving treatment in Afghanistan and identify factors associated with poor hypertension control. The research addresses the urgent public health issue of hypertension management in developing countries, particularly in conflict-prone regions like Afghanistan.

3. **Research Methods:**
   A cross-sectional study was conducted at three public hospitals in Afghanistan from August to December 2022. The researchers used convenience sampling to select hospitals and a systematic sampling method to recruit 950 patients on initial visits and follow-up appointments. Data collection was conducted through structured questionnaires, and statistical analysis involved descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with uncontrolled hypertension.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The study found that 77.3% of the 853 patients had uncontrolled hypertension. Factors significantly associated with uncontrolled hypertension included physical inactivity, smoking, high salt intake, higher BMI, presence of medical comorbidities, poor compliance with antihypertensive medications (AHMs), and depressive symptoms.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies:**
   The study did not specifically focus on legal frameworks or policies related to hypertension or human rights in the healthcare system. However, it indirectly highlights gaps in healthcare services and the need for policy interventions in Afghanistan's healthcare sector.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors concluded that the high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension in Afghanistan requires urgent attention. They recommended targeting associated factors through behavior change, promoting physical activity, dietary modifications, enhancing treatment adherence, smoking cessation, and addressing mental health issues to improve hypertension management.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The study has several limitations, including measuring blood pressure only during follow-up visits, potential misclassification due to single-visit measurements, and limited generalizability as the study was confined to three hospitals. The cross-sectional design restricts causal inference. Additionally, the study did not account for some factors like patient education and secondary causes of hypertension. Political instability and resource constraints in Afghanistan may have impacted data availability and the scope of the study.

In summary, tackling uncontrolled hypertension in Afghanistan involves addressing lifestyle factors, improving healthcare access and adherence to medication, and considering the broader social and political challenges impacting health outcomes.",No abstract available
Deterring Migration in Times of Crises: The Ethics of Behavioral Change in Migration Information Campaigns,Nassim Majidi,https://doi.org/10.1177/00027642231183268,2023-7-2,"['Tufts University', 'University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg', 'SAMUEL HALL EAST AFRICA LIMITED']",Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available," The European migration “crisis” has led to new policy and funding mechanisms, such as the European Trust Fund for Africa and funding from the UK Home Office that have in common a dual, and often contradictory, objective: to support migrant protection, while reinforcing a migration management or migration control agenda. They have given flexibility, in a context of “crisis response,” to a range of actors with different levels of responsibilities and of transparency when reaching out to migrants, at times to the detriment of one aspect (the respect for human rights) for the benefit of another (irregular migration control), and with questionable results. This article provides an analysis of one program implemented in Ethiopia and Afghanistan: an information campaign implemented between 2016 and 2019, with a focus on behavioral change among potential migrants. This case study reveals practices in migration information campaigns that go against existing standards in social and behavioral communications campaigns. Building on such standards, the article provides a critical lens through which to assess migration information campaigns, through the prism of three criteria outlined in the paper and used to evaluate the results of the program, and provides a way forward for setting standards in planning and implementating migration information campaigns.

I., and Masoom, M. K. was published in the Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention. Here is a summary based on the specified points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**:
   Afghanistan has faced ongoing conflict and instability, which has severely impacted its healthcare system. The country struggles with limited resources and infrastructure, making it challenging to provide adequate medical care, including for cancer patients.

2. **Purpose of the Research**:
   The study aims to estimate the costs of treating five common types of cancer in Afghanistan, distinguishing between out-of-pocket expenses incurred by patients and governmental costs. This research addresses the broader challenge of health equity and access to affordable cancer treatment in a country with a fragile healthcare system.

3. **Research Methods**:
   The authors conducted a cost analysis by collecting data on cancer treatment expenses in Afghanistan, focusing on both direct (governmental) and indirect (out-of-pocket) costs. The study used data from hospitals and clinics across the country to gather relevant financial information.

4. **Main Findings**:
   The research identified significant costs associated with cancer treatment that patients in Afghanistan face, often leading to financial hardship. There is a heavy reliance on out-of-pocket spending due to insufficient governmental support, reflecting a broader trend of healthcare inaccessibility for economically disadvantaged populations.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies**:

Sociodemographic Predictors of Initiating Antenatal Care Visits by Pregnant Women During First Trimester of Pregnancy: Findings from the Afghanistan Health Survey 2018,"Essa Tawfiq, Mohammad Rafi Fazli, Abdul Wahed Wasiq, Muhammad Haroon Stanikzai, Amena Mansouri, Sayed Ataullah Saeedzai",https://doi.org/10.2147/IJWH.S399544,2023-4,['The University of Auckland'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Education']","['Maternal Health', 'Nutrition']",,"**Summary:**

1. **Context:** Maternal mortality rates are particularly high in low- and middle-income countries, with South Asia accounting for a significant portion. Inadequate access to quality antenatal care (ANC) is a major contributor to maternal deaths. Afghanistan reports low usage of ANC services, with a substantial gap between current ANC practices and WHO recommendations for timely and adequate ANC visits.

2. **Purpose and Research Questions:** This study aims to identify the sociodemographic factors influencing timely initiation of ANC visits among ever-married women in Afghanistan, addressing the human rights challenge of accessing maternal healthcare and reducing preventable maternal deaths.

3. **Research Methods:** The study utilized data from the Afghanistan Health Survey 2018, analyzing responses from ever-married women aged 14–49 who were pregnant or had given birth in the two years preceding the survey. A two-stage sampling method was employed, and a generalized linear model was used for statistical analysis.

4. **Main Findings:** Only 55.8% of women began ANC visits during the first trimester, revealing access and timing issues. Key predictors for timely ANC included women's age, literacy, wealth status, urban residence, pregnancy intention, and media access. Access to a doctor or midwife also increased the likelihood of timely ANC visits.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:** While the study does not directly explore Afghanistan's legal frameworks, it highlights significant gaps in access to maternal healthcare and potential targets for policy intervention to improve ANC services and adherence to WHO guidelines.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:** The authors recommend policy interventions to promote early initiation of ANC, including expanding educational opportunities, increasing awareness through media, and deploying healthcare resources effectively, particularly in rural areas, to address the identified disparities.

7. **Limitations:** The study acknowledges limitations such as potential recall and social desirability biases, a lack of detailed timing in ANC visits, and missing data on women's initial knowledge about ANC. The political instability in Afghanistan may also impact data reliability and the applicability of recommendations.",No abstract available
Does receiving a cash grant improve individual earnings in a war-torn country?  Evidence from a randomized experiment in Afghanistan,"Fatema Kashefi, Hisahiro Naito",https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.72893.2,2023-4-12,"['University of Tsukuba', 'Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs']",Article,1,Yes,"['Economy and Infrastructure', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Employment', 'Financial Inclusion', 'Migration', 'Disaster Risk Reduction']",,"Here is a structured summary of the article you provided:

### 1. Historical, Political, or Social Context
The article appears to be set within the context of Afghanistan, a country challenged by economic instability and high poverty levels. Given the historical backdrop of conflict and political instability, initiatives like cash grants and mentorships are crucial to stimulate economic activity and improve livelihoods.

### 2. Purpose of the Research
The research aims to evaluate the impact of cash grants and mentorship programs on income generation and asset accumulation among Afghan men and women, particularly addressing economic empowerment and improving living conditions within a human rights framework. The study explores whether financial aid can effectively uplift economically disadvantaged groups and bridge gender disparities.

### 3. Research Methods
The researchers used randomized control trial (RCT) methodology to assess the impact of the interventions, employing a combination of balancing tests, histograms, and panel data analysis. Various statistical techniques, including inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimation, Generalized Moment Method (GMM), and treatment effect bounds, were applied to control for attrition bias and ensure robustness.

### 4. Main Findings
- Cash grants significantly increased monthly earnings for both men and women, though the impact was greater for men (4,839 Afs/month) compared to women (1,900 Afs/month).
- Grant recipients had a higher likelihood of starting officially registered businesses and employing both household and non-household members in micro-enterprises.
- The grants enhanced asset levels, such as bicycles and household goods, to a greater extent in males than females.
- Mentorship alone did not significantly boost monthly earnings without the cash grants.

### 5. Examination of Legal Frameworks
The article does not extensively delve into the country's legal frameworks or policies related to human rights beyond economic metrics.

### 6. Conclusions and Recommendations
The authors concluded that cash grants effectively increased economic outcomes and business activities, suggesting financial aid as a viable tool for economic empowerment. The study recommends continuing such grants to support micro-enterprises, especially focusing on tailored interventions that address the distinct needs of male and female entrepreneurs.

### 7. Limitations of the Study
- High attrition rates due to administrative errors reduced the end-line sample size, potentially affecting the robustness of conclusions.
- Limitations related to political instability and challenges in data collection are acknowledged, as well as potential bias due to unaccounted variables or external economic impacts not covered within the study.

Overall, the study highlights the positive impact of cash grants on economic activity in Afghanistan, with considerations for addressing gender disparities in economic empowerment.","Background: In this study, the effect of receiving a non-trivial cash grant and mentorship for business practice on individual earnings in Afghanistan was assessed.  Methods: This randomized control trial (RCT) included 2177 individuals (n=2177), with the age range of 18-35 years. The amount of cash grant (500 USD) was approximately equal to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the country.  By a process of lottery, eligible applicants were equally divided into the group that received the grant (treatment group) and the group that did not (control group).  Results: Almost two years after this study, the percentage of increased annual income to the size of this cash grant was approximately 173 % and 69 % for males and females, respectively. This result was much higher than the estimated percentage reported in previous literature assessing the effect of microfinance loans and cash grants in other countries.  The treatment group had 7% higher probability of having an officially registered business than the control group. The treatment group also increased labor supply and employed additional workers, compared to the control group. The male treatment group bought more capital equipment (e.g., trike and commercial carts) than the male control group, while the female treatment group bought more domestic animals. Conclusion: A non-trivial cash grant has a strong positive effect on the earnings of the recipient of the cash grant in Afghanistan. If the state of increased income continues for the next few years, the sum of increased income will be more than the sum of the administration cost, the interest cost and the amount of cash grant given.  This implies that the project passes the standard criteria to determine the appropriateness of government program. Additionally, we did not find any economically and statistically significant positive effect of mentorship on income."

Here's a summary addressing the specified points:

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context**: Asia, despite being poised for future economic development due to its substantial energy resources, has historically been plagued by political tensions, conflicts, terrorism, and wars. The region hosts major producers and consumers of fossil energy, creating both rivalry and cooperation opportunities. Notably, Afghanistan plays a strategic role as a land-based hub connecting South Asia, Central Asia, China, and the Middle East.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The paper seems to focus on the strategic importance of energy resources in Asia and its implications for regional stability and connectivity. Although the article primarily discusses geopolitical and economic dynamics, these have indirect human rights implications such as the impact of conflicts on civilians and access to energy as a basic need.

3. **Research Methods**: The article does not explicitly detail any research methods but appears to employ a geopolitical analysis based on the current political and economic landscape, focusing on the roles of major powers and regional dynamics.

4. **Main Findings**: The article identifies the competition over energy resources between the USA, China, and Russia as a central issue, exacerbating regional tensions. However, it also highlights the potential for economic growth and connectivity, particularly using Afghanistan as a strategic energy corridor, provided stability is achieved.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: There is no specific mention of the examination of legal frameworks or policies within the country's or region's human rights context.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The text concludes that stability in Afghanistan is crucial for unlocking economic and connectivity potentials in the region, suggesting that peace in Afghanistan could enable significant energy trade and transit opportunities.

7. **Limitations**: The article does not explicitly discuss its limitations. However, given the political climate's complexity and the sensitivity of human rights issues in the region, challenges may include data availability and geopolitical volatility impacting stability and development efforts.

The focus remains primarily on geopolitical and economic perspectives, with indirect implications for human rights through stability and development discourses.","&lt;abstract&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asia, where future world economic development is predicted and most of the energy resources are buried, has not been able to utilize its energy resources efficiently and remained at the core of political tensions, conflicts, terrorism and wars for decades. Major producers and consumers of fossil energy are located in this continent, and the potential of a vast energy market is inevitable. There are several challenges and opportunities associated with the energy trade in the region. On the one hand, the rivalries and competition over energy resources and territorial ownership and control between the USA, China and Russia have been the sources of most political and security issues in the region. However, on the other hand, the fast economic growth and availability of energy resources open up numerous trade and connectivity opportunities for the region. Afghanistan is a strategic state that serves as a geographic land-based hub for South Asia, Central Asia, China and the Middle East. It is no longer considered a land-locked country, but a strategic and key land link for the whole region. Afghanistan is the most economical and inimitable terrestrial corridor for the regional energy trade and transit upon which all stakeholders agree. Stability in Afghanistan will significantly change the importance of this region and open up doors for the realization of various mega projects, businesses and cultural exchange opportunities. Energy, as a strategic commodity for all of the regional countries, especially India and China as major consumers at present and in the future, will be a mega trade and connectivity opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

Aims: To review the HRH situation of outsourced healthcare services in Afghanistan and evaluate nongovernment organization (NGO) investments in the health workforce. Methods: Two questionnaires were used for data collection. One gathered information about the characteristics of HRH in 2020 and the other collected budgetary data for 2017–2020 to analyse budget allocation and expenditure by NGOs on the health workforce. Results: A total of 25 262 (65% male, 35% female) individuals were employed by NGOs in 31 provinces of Afghanistan. There was a critical shortage of personnel and a prevalence of gender imbalance across all provinces. Healthcare workers were mostly aged 26 to 30 years. Services were mostly provided by local NGOs and their scopes were not limited to outsourced projects. More than 75% of the budget of NGOs was allocated to the health workforce in 2017–2020, and more than 70% of allocations was spent on staff salaries, followed by other health workforce expenditure. Less than 5% was spent on capacity building. Conclusion: There is a gross shortage and large gender imbalance in the Afghanistan health workforce. It is essential to maintain and increase current financial and technical investments to ensure sustainability and enhance the fragile health system in Afghanistan."

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context**: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a leading cause of death globally, contributing to 74.3% of deaths in 2019. Afghanistan, a low-income country with poor health indicators, is experiencing a rising burden of NCDs similar to many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The study aims to identify strategies that countries with low premature death rates from NCDs use to manage these diseases, providing insights into controlling Afghanistan's escalating NCD issue, which poses public health and human rights challenges.

3. **Research Methods**: The researchers conducted a scoping review following Arksey and O'Malley's six-step protocol. They searched eight international databases and gray literature up to November 2021, evaluating documents according to the PRISMA guidelines. A total of 122 articles from 1984 to 2021 were analyzed using content analysis.

4. **Main Findings**: The study identified 35 strategies across nine themes (e.g., tobacco use, healthy diet). Common strategies include smoking cessation programs, dietary guidance, and physical activity promotions. Canada, Korea, and the UK had the most published documents on NCDs strategies.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The study reviewed strategies in countries with strong policies against NCD risk factors like tobacco use and unhealthy diets. Policy measures analyzed include taxation, regulation of marketing, and public health campaigns.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors recommend Afghanistan's Ministry of Public Health, WHO, and other stakeholders use the study's insights to formulate cost-effective, practical strategies for NCD control. Stronger health governance, increased health literacy, and multi-sectoral engagement are necessary to tackle NCDs in Afghanistan.

7. **Limitations**: The study is limited by Afghanistan's political climate, lack of reliable data, and limited implementation capacity. These factors create challenges in adapting international strategies effectively to the local context.

The researchers call for international support in strengthening Afghanistan's public health policies to reduce the NCD burden amidst ongoing socio-political challenges.","Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their risk factors are the leading cause of death worldwide and contribute to 74.3% of deaths globally in 2019. The burden of NCDs is escalating in Afghanistan. Currently, every seconds, people in Afghanistan are dying of NCDs. Addressing this challenge in Afghanistan needs effective and practical interventions. This study aimed to identify the strategies developed and implemented in countries with low non-communicable premature death. To conduct a scoping review, we followed the six-step Arksey and O'Malley protocol and searched for eligible articles on eight international databases and the gray literature. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The inclusion criteria were English documents and evidence produced up to 30 November 2021 for the control of NCDs. We excluded incomplete texts, duplicates, and dissertations due to lack of access. We used EndNote X9 and MaxQDA software for data management and analysis. We conducted content analysis for this study. A total of 122 documents developed between 1984 and 2021 met the inclusion criteria. We identified 35 strategies from which the most used strategies were related to unhealthy diets and smoking cessation programs. Canada (26.4%), Korea (19.8%), and the United Kingdom (19%) have the most publications on the control and prevention of NCDs among the countries included in the study. Most strategies were implemented over 2 years (41%). This study recommends specific interventions to control and prevent NCDs for the main risk factors of tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and the main non-communicable diseases such as heart diseases, cancers, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Afghanistan Ministry of Public Health, the WHO country office, and other involved stakeholders can use the findings of this review to design and implement strategies for controlling and preventing NCDs in Afghanistan. International organizations such as the World Health Organization, United Nations Agencies, the World Bank, and other involving communities should invest in strengthening good health governance in Afghanistan. The Afghan Government should focus on promoting and funding health literacy among the public and self-care to control and prevent NCDs."

Parikh focuses on the current state and challenges of cervical cancer prevention and control in nine South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries. Here is a summary of the article, addressing the specified points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Cervical cancer remains a critical health issue, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where 90% of global fatalities occur. Despite global improvements in reducing cervical cancer incidence through better hygiene and screening, the absolute number of cases continues to rise, especially in LMICs.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research aims to evaluate cervical cancer prevention strategies in SAARC countries, specifically examining screening and vaccination practices as human rights issues. It addresses challenges like limited access to healthcare and resources needed for effective prevention.

3. **Research Methods**: The study utilized an online survey conducted in January 2023, wherein 367 responses were collected from nine SAARC countries. The survey included a 21-question multiple-choice questionnaire aimed at assessing cervical cancer screening and vaccination strategies.

4. **Main Findings**: The survey revealed a varied landscape of cervical cancer control practices. Bhutan and Nepal were optimistic about achieving World Health Assembly targets for cervical cancer elimination. Most countries recommended screening for all eligible asymptomatic patients. A dual screening strategy (HPV DNA plus cytology) was favored by healthcare providers in several countries, while Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka preferred a comprehensive approach of screening, triage, and treatment. HPV vaccination was endorsed for girls aged 10 to 26 across many countries, contingent on vaccine affordability.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies**: While the article does not delve deeply into specific legal frameworks, it highlights a broad consensus on the need for vaccination and screening programs, indicating a policy focus on improving women's health services and increasing access to HPV vaccines.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The study concludes that while significant challenges remain in cervical cancer prevention in the SAARC region, there is consensus on leveraging both public and private sectors to address these issues. It suggests enhancing affordability and accessibility of HPV vaccines and screening programs as critical steps forward. 

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The research acknowledges potential limitations related to political climate, healthcare infrastructure disparities, and vaccine cost barriers. Challenges also include the variability in the availability of data and the sensitivity required in discussing healthcare strategies across different countries with diverse socio-economic and political backgrounds.

Overall, the study underscores the need for strategic, region-specific approaches to cervical cancer prevention, emphasizing the importance of cooperation and shared solutions among SAARC countries.","In the year 2020, a total of 342 000 women were estimated to die of cervical cancer, of which 90%) were expected amongst low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Globally incidence of cervical cancer has reduced as a result of improved personal hygiene, better living conditions and higher application of opportunistic screening programs. Yet GLOBOCAN shows that absolute number of cases are still increasing.We therefore conducted a 21 question multiple choice questionnaire online survey in Jan 2023 amongst 9 SAARC countries. A total of 367 replies were received and the representative answers for each country are being reported in this manuscript.A good possibility of achieving World Health Assembly target (Nov 17, 2020) was felt only by Bhutan and Nepal. For screening, most countries (Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) recommend for all asymptomatic eligible patients. Public health experts have suggested VIA / VILI as the best solution for LMICs. However, a dual screening strategy (HPV DNA plus) cytology was preferred by doctors in Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.Screening, triage and then treatment was the preferred by Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka.HPV vaccination was recommended in all girls between ages 10 to 26 years in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. All the 9 countries would use HPV vaccination to all eligible patients if the cost of the vaccine was reasonably low.Our survey clearly outlines challenges faced in tackling cervical cancer in SAARC countries. We also provide consensus regarding several potential solutions that can be used in both public and private cervical cancer control programs."

Essential childhood immunization in 43 low- and middle-income countries: Analysis of spatial trends and socioeconomic inequalities in vaccine coverage,"Anna Dimitrova, Gabriel Carrasco-Escobar, Robin Richardson, Tarik Benmarhnia",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004166,2023-1-17,['Scripps Institution of Oceanography'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Disease Prevention', 'Nutrition', 'Migration', 'Food Security']",,"### Summary of the Article:

1. **Overview of Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Over the past five decades, global access to essential vaccines has significantly improved. However, recent years have seen a slowdown and reversal in immunization progress, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). These regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, continue to struggle with high child mortality rates from vaccine-preventable diseases. The 2021 Immunization Agenda aims to address these disparities by increasing global vaccine coverage and equity.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Challenges:**
   The research focuses on understanding the disparities in child immunization coverage within and between countries. It seeks to identify hard-to-reach populations, particularly those facing socioeconomic barriers, to close the vaccination gap and reduce preventable child deaths.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study analyzed data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted across 43 LMICs, covering over 220,000 children. The data were used to estimate immunization coverage and socioeconomic inequalities at national and subnational levels. Statistical tools such as concentration indices and Theil index were employed to measure wealth-related inequalities and spatial disparities.

4. **Main Findings:**
   Significant subnational disparities exist in child immunization rates, with regions like West and Central Africa and South Asia showing extremely low vaccine coverage. In areas like Angola, Chad, Nigeria, and Afghanistan, less than 10% of children are fully immunized. Children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are consistently less likely to be vaccinated. 

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies:**
   The article notes structural barriers within countries impacting vaccine access but does not specifically delve into legal frameworks. It mentions the role of international programs like WHO’s Expanded Program on Immunization and Gavi in boosting vaccine distribution to poorer nations.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors highlight the urgent need for localized interventions to address both geographic and socioeconomic disparities in vaccine coverage. They recommend prioritizing vulnerable populations in immunization programs and improving vaccine distribution mechanisms to ensure universal access by 2030.

7. **Study Limitations:**
   The study’s limitations include reliance on parental reports for vaccination records, varying survey periods between 2014 and 2021, potential data bias, and limited differentiation between vaccines given through routine services versus campaigns. Additionally, political climates and operational challenges during data collection may affect accuracy and comparability across regions.

This article underscores the critical nature of achieving equitable vaccine distribution as a fundamental human right, necessary for reducing child mortality in vulnerable populations.","
Background
Globally, access to life-saving vaccines has improved considerably in the past 5 decades. However, progress has started to slow down and even reverse in recent years. Understanding subnational heterogeneities in essential child immunization will be critical for closing the global vaccination gap.


Methods and findings
We use vaccination information for over 220,000 children across 1,366 administrative regions in 43 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys. We estimate essential immunization coverage at the national and subnational levels and quantify socioeconomic inequalities in such coverage using adjusted concentration indices. Within- and between-country variations are summarized via the Theil index. We use local indicator of spatial association (LISA) statistics to identify clusters of administrative regions with high or low values. Finally, we estimate the number of missed vaccinations among children aged 15 to 35 months across all 43 countries and the types of vaccines most often missed. We show that national-level vaccination rates can conceal wide subnational heterogeneities. Large gaps in child immunization are found across West and Central Africa and in South Asia, particularly in regions of Angola, Chad, Nigeria, Guinea, and Afghanistan, where less than 10% of children are fully immunized. Furthermore, children living in these countries consistently lack all 4 basic vaccines included in the WHO’s recommended schedule for young children. Across most countries, children from poorer households are less likely to be fully immunized. The main limitations include subnational estimates based on large administrative divisions for some countries and different periods of survey data collection.


Conclusions
The identified heterogeneities in essential childhood immunization, especially given that some regions consistently are underserved for all basic vaccines, can be used to inform the design and implementation of localized intervention programs aimed at eliminating child suffering and deaths from existing and novel vaccine-preventable diseases.

"Healthcare collapse in Afghanistan due to political crises, natural catastrophes, and dearth of international aid post-COVID","Ngoc Phuong Hong Tao, Dang Nguyen, Sayed Mansoor Sediqi, Linh Tran, Nguyen Tien Huy",https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.13.03003,2023-1-11,['Chelsea High School'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['COVID-19', 'Migration']",,"**Summary of the Article**

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:** 
   - Afghanistan’s health sector, heavily reliant on foreign aid, collapsed following the Taliban’s takeover as US and NATO forces withdrew. The political turmoil compounded existing issues from the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to severe deterioration of healthcare services. Protracted conflict, natural disasters, and international aid suspension worsened the situation.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Challenges:**
   - The research investigates the human rights implications of a deteriorating health care system in Afghanistan, focusing on accessibility challenges to basic medical care. It highlights the impacts on vulnerable populations due to political instability, health workforce shortages, and the absence of foreign aid.

3. **Research Methods Used:**
   - The study utilizes historical data analysis and synthesis of recent reports and surveys. It examines healthcare worker statistics, the impact of natural disasters on health systems, and the socio-economic implications of aid suspension.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - There is a significant shortage of healthcare professionals, with only 9.4 health workers per 10,000 people, exacerbated by brain drain. Many health facilities face closure without international aid, reducing healthcare access dramatically. Natural disasters have intensified public health crises, leading to outbreaks of diseases such as malaria, measles, and COVID-19. The economic dependency on external aid has left millions in need of humanitarian assistance.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   - The analysis indicates that the Taliban takeover disrupted legal and policy frameworks facilitating healthcare, with halted foreign aid crippling health reform efforts. Critical support mechanisms previously funded by international bodies like the World Bank are now absent.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - The authors conclude that Afghanistan's health crisis will persist and potentially worsen without international intervention and comprehensive funding. They recommend recognizing the country's emergency needs and resolving political issues to restore healthcare and humanitarian services.

7. **Study Limitations:**
   - Limitations include the scarcity of reliable data due to the political climate and restricted information flow. The volatile situation under Taliban rule and sensitivities around human rights documentation also constrain analyses.",No abstract available
Patterns of Palliation: A Review of Casualties That Received Pain Management Before Reaching Role 2 in Afghanistan,"Ian L Hudson, Amanda M Staudt, Matthew Burgess, Carmen Hinojosa-Laborde, Steven G Schauer, Ryan K Newberry, Kathy L Ryan, Christopher A VanFosson",https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usac211,2022-9-13,"['Brooke Army Medical Center', 'U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research']",Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"ABSTRACT
               
                  Introduction
                  Battlefield pain management changed markedly during the first 20 years of the Global War on Terror. Morphine, long the mainstay of combat analgesia, diminished in favor of fentanyl and ketamine for military pain control, but the options are not hemodynamically or psychologically equivalent. Understanding patterns of prehospital analgesia may reveal further opportunities for combat casualty care improvement.
               
               
                  Materials and Methods
                  Using Department of Defense Trauma Registry data for the Afghanistan conflict from 2005 to 2018, we examined 2,402 records of prehospital analgesia administration to assess temporal trends in medication choice and proportions receiving analgesia, including subanalysis of a cohort screened for an indication with minimal contraindication for analgesia. We further employed frequency matching to explore the presence of disparities in analgesia by casualty affiliation.
               
               
                  Results
                  Proportions of documented analgesia increased throughout the study period, from 0% in 2005 to 70.6% in 2018. Afghan casualties had the highest proportion of documented analgesia (53.0%), versus U.S. military (31.9%), civilian/other (23.3%), and non-U.S. military (19.3%). Fentanyl surpassed morphine in the frequency of administration in 2012. The median age of those receiving ketamine was higher (30 years) than those receiving fentanyl (26 years) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (23 years). Among the frequency-matched subanalysis, the odds ratio for ketamine administration with Afghan casualties was 1.84 (95% CI, 1.30-2.61).
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  We observed heterogeneity of prehospital patient care across patient affiliation groups, suggesting possible opportunities for improvement toward an overall best practice system. General increase in documented prehospital pain management likely reflects efforts toward complete documentation, as well as improved options for analgesia. Current combat casualty care documentation does not include any standardized pain scale.

Moreover, in 2019 the regional age-standardized YLD rate was 15.8 per 100,000 population, an 11.7% increase since 1990. In 2019, Qatar and Afghanistan had the highest and lowest age-standardized YLD rates, respectively. Regionally, the age-standardized point prevalence of gout increased with age up to the oldest age group, and it was more prevalent among males in all age groups. In addition, there was an overall positive association between SDI and the burden of gout between 1990 and 2019. In 2019, high BMI (46.1%) was the largest contributor to the burden of gout in the MENA region.ConclusionThere were large intercountry variations in the burden of gout, but in general, it has increased in MENA over the last 3 decades. This increase is in line with the global trends of gout. However, the age-standardized YLD rate change was higher in MENA than at the global level."

Most people with hepatitis B are in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMIC), where health systems and resources are often constrained. Refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons (IDPs) often face barriers in seeking health care and are a priority population at risk of hepatitis B. No systematic review to date has evaluated the prevalence of hepatitis B amongst refugees in in LMIC. We undertook a systematic review of the literature identifying 28 studies addressing this topic. Though few studies on this topic exist, the available evidence suggests a high prevalence amongst refugees in LMIC, with wide variation between and within countries. Possible risk factors contributing to hepatitis B include unsafe injections, low immunization coverage, low awareness, mother‐to‐child transmission, and limited health services. Further study is needed to better understand the prevalence and risk factors for hepatitis B amongst refugees in LMIC, to inform public health responses. Vulnerable populations such as refugees are an important group to consider in national and global efforts to eliminate hepatitis B."

The detrimental nature of polio calls for action of global vaccination. Owing to large‐scale vaccination efforts, many countries have been declared polio‐free and people are fully vaccinated against poliovirus. However, concern still remains as new cases are being identified in countries declared polio‐free. This scenario is particularly noticed due to the comprised healthcare system in the past 3 years of the Corona pandemic. Conditions for lower‐middle‐income countries are more problematic, where there are meager healthcare resources and the burden on the healthcare system is higher. Studies indicate some cases of non‐paralytic species of polio including cVDPV1, cVDPV2, and cVDPV3 in the group of outbreak countries. However, the major problem is associated with wild‐type poliovirus, that is, WPV1 which leads to paralytic disease and is still present in endemic countries, such as Afghanistan and Pakistan. The incidence rate of wild polio cases has significantly decreased in comparison to the past years but the problem needs to be dealt with at the grass‐roots level. In this article, the most recent data have been collected pertaining to the incidence of multivariant species of poliovirus, with a special focus on endemic and outbreak countries. A short overview of challenges to vaccination and a recommendatory overview has also been included for dealing with polio surges."

Following Emmanuel Levinas's understanding of ethics as arising from intersubjective face‐to‐face encounters, the study illuminates the experiential origins of the humanitarian commitment by analysing James Orbinski's memoir entitled An Imperfect Offering: Dispatches from the Medical Frontline. Orbinski, a former International Council President at Médecins Sans Frontières, was directly involved in humanitarian responses to several major crises during the 1990s, including those in Somalia, Afghanistan, Rwanda, and what was then Zaire. This paper explores three formative experiences from Orbinski's childhood and teenage years to analyse the personal ethics of humanitarian aid workers and to illuminate the intersection of the personal and professional level of humanitarian aid work. Illustrating that Orbinski's humanitarian commitment is a surrendering to the other's call, the paper argues for stronger inclusion of aid workers' lives and experiences to achieve a comprehensive understanding of humanitarian work."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**:
   - The article discusses unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC) in the UK, who are minors seeking asylum without parental care. In the year ending March 2021, the UK saw over 32,400 asylum claims, with 2,044 (6%) being UASC. The care of these children is mandated under the Children Act 1989, which requires local authorities to provide support including healthcare.

2. **Purpose of the Research**:
   - The research aims to evaluate the Unity Clinic’s infectious disease screening programme for UASC. It addresses challenges related to the physical health of these children, noting high incidences of tuberculosis (TB), bloodborne viruses (BBVs), and parasitic infections alongside their mental health issues. The study seeks to understand and improve healthcare support for this vulnerable group.

3. **Research Methods**:
   - A face-to-face ‘one-stop shop’ infectious disease clinic called the Unity Clinic was implemented. This clinic conducted comprehensive health assessments, including screening for infectious diseases and taking general medical histories when Initial Health Assessments (IHAs) faced delays, particularly heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic.

4. **Main Findings**:
   - The audit aimed to identify infection rates and additional health needs among UASC. While specific infection rates are not detailed in the summary, the findings are likely aligned with the high prevalence of TB and BBVs in this demographic group in previous literature.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**:
   - The article briefly outlines the UK legal frameworks, such as the Children Act 1989, which mandates local authorities to provide support to UASC including healthcare services. It mentions national health guidelines recommending communicable disease screening for looked-after children.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**:
   - Conclusions and recommendations are not detailed in the provided text, but the study's intention to evaluate healthcare delivery suggests recommendations would likely focus on improving infectious disease screening and healthcare access for UASC, particularly in light of pandemic-induced challenges.

7. **Limitations of the Study**:
   - Limitations include delays in healthcare assessments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, potential reluctance or fear of healthcare access among UASC, and sensitivity issues surrounding their immigration status. The political climate and data challenges also pose potential limitations, though they are not explicitly stated in the provided text.

Overall, the study centers around enhancing healthcare for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in the UK by reviewing and improving screening processes within the constraints of existing legal frameworks and the ongoing pandemic.","ObjectiveEvaluate the Unity Clinic’s infectious disease screening programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC), calculate rates of infection and identify further health needs.DesignRetrospective audit of electronic patient data.Setting and patientsUASC who attended the Unity Clinic between 1 November 2019 and 22 March 2022.Main outcome measuresBaseline demographics, social, mental health and journey details, infection screening and investigation results.Results155 UASC were reviewed: 89% (138 of 155) male, median age 17 years (IQR 16–17). Most frequent countries of origin were Sudan, Eritrea and Afghanistan. Median duration of travel to the UK (n=79) was 2 years (IQR 0.5–4); 35.6% (47 of 132) arrived by boat and 54.5% (72 of 132) by road. 44.8% (69 of 154) had one or more positive infection screening results: 22.7% (35 of 154) and 1.3% (2 of 154) positive for latent and active tuberculosis, respectively; 4.6% (7 of 152) chronic active hepatitis B and 17.1% (26 of 152) for past infection; 1.3% (2 of 154) for HIV; 13.0% (19 of 146) forStrongyloides. There were three cases of syphilis (n=152; 2.0%) and one chlamydia (n=148; 0.7%)—none of whom disclosed prior sexual activity during screening. 39.6% (61 of 154) and 27.9% (43/154) reported disturbances to mood or sleep, respectively. 55.2% (85 of 154) disclosed traumatic incidents during and/or prior to their journey, including physical and sexual assault.ConclusionsThe Unity Clinic provides a thorough infectious disease screening service for UASC following national guidance. Results highlight the need for universal, non-judgemental screening for sexually transmitted infections, as targeted screening would not identify positive cases. High rates of well-being issues and previous abuse emphasise the need for multidisciplinary, collaborative approaches to care."
Comparing Risks of Firearm-Related Death and Injury among Young Adult Males in Selected US Cities with Wartime Service in Iraq and Afghanistan,"Brandon del Pozo, Alex Knorre, Michael J. Mello, Aaron Chalfin",https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.48132,2022-12-22,"['Rhode Island Hospital', 'The Warren Alpert Medical School']",Article,1,Yes,"['Security and Conflict', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Veterans', 'Peace Initiatives', 'Disease Prevention', 'Public Safety']",,"Here is a summary of the article based on the requested points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:** The United States witnessed a significant rise in homicides in 2020, with firearm injuries becoming the leading cause of death among youth. This marks a public health crisis that underscores racial and ethnic disparities as minority communities are disproportionately affected.

2. **Purpose of the Research:** The study aims to assess the relative risks of firearm-related deaths and injuries for young adult males in four major U.S. cities—Chicago, Philadelphia, New York City, and Los Angeles—compared to the risks faced by military personnel in war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. It highlights critical human rights issues related to urban violence and public safety disparities.

3. **Research Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 129,826 young adult males aged 18-29 from the most violent zip codes in the aforementioned cities. The study used aggregated fatal and nonfatal shooting data from 2020 and 2021, compared against military mortality and injury rates from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. The risk assessments involved calculating relative risks using zip code-level aggregated data and demographic information from the U.S. Census.

4. **Main Findings:** Young adult males residing in the most violent areas of Chicago and Philadelphia faced higher firearm-related death risks than soldiers in war zones. The majority of affected individuals were from minoritized racial and ethnic backgrounds. The study found considerable racial disparities, with Black and Hispanic males bearing over 96% of the firearm-related burdens.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:** While the study does not directly assess legal frameworks, it calls attention to the urgent need for strategic violence reduction interventions and trauma-informed support mechanisms akin to those offered to veterans.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:** The authors conclude that firearm violence in certain U.S. urban areas presents risks greater than or comparable to those faced by military personnel in combat zones. They recommend prioritizing urban health strategies, focusing on violence reduction, trauma-informed approaches, and addressing the specific needs of racially and ethnically marginalized communities.

7. **Limitations:** The study was limited by the public availability of data, which excluded some large cities, and the inability to analyze risks within subpopulations at varying levels of risk. Additionally, it used aggregated data which might obscure specific community dynamics, and did not account for different military roles and deployments, potentially affecting risk comparisons.

These findings underline the urgent need for policy interventions to address the high levels of firearm violence in urban settings, particularly those that directly impact marginalized groups.","ImportanceIn 2020, homicides in the United States saw a record single-year increase, with firearm injuries becoming the leading cause of death for children, adolescents, and young adults. It is critical to understand the magnitude of this crisis to formulate an effective response.ObjectiveTo evaluate whether young adult males living in parts of 4 major US cities faced a firearm-related death and injury risk comparable with risks encountered during recent wartime service in Iraq and Afghanistan.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsIn this cross-sectional study of young adult males aged 18 to 29 years living in the top 10% most violent zip codes in each domestic setting (as measured by fatal shooting rates), fatal and nonfatal shooting data for 2020 and 2021 were aggregated at the zip code level for 4 of the largest US cities (Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; New York, New York; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). Wartime mortality and combat injury rates for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan were used to assess relative risk.Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe relative risk of firearm-related death and nonfatal shootings in each setting as compared with combat death and injury in the comparator setting.ResultsOf 129 826 young adult males aged 18 to 29 years living in the top 10% most violent zip codes in the 4 cities studied, 45 725 (35.2%) were Black, 71 005 (54.7%) were Hispanic, and 40 355 (31.1%) were White. Among this population, there were 470 homicides and 1684 firearm-related injuries. Young adult males living in the most violent zip code of Chicago (2585 individuals aged 20-29 y) and Philadelphia (2448 individuals aged 18-29 y) faced a higher risk of firearm-related homicide than US soldiers who were deployed to Afghanistan, with risk ratios of 3.23 (95% CI, 2.47-4.68) and 1.91 (95% CI, 1.32-3.46), respectively. In expanding the analysis to the top 10% of the cities’ most violent zip codes, the risks in Chicago likewise exceeded those of combat death faced by military service members, with a risk ratio of 2.10 (95% CI, 1.82-2.46), and the risks in Philadelphia were comparable with those of deployment to war 1.15 (95% CI, 0.98-1.39). Nonfatal shooting risks were comparable with, or exceeded, the injury risk of combat in Iraq, producing a combined annual firearm risk of 5.8% in Chicago and 3.2% in Philadelphia. However, these findings were not observed in the most violent zip codes of Los Angeles and New York City, where young men faced a 70% to 91% lower risk than soldiers in the Afghanistan war across fatal and nonfatal categories (eg, fatal shooting in most violent zip code in Los Angeles: risk ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.26-0.34; nonfatal shooting in top 10% most violent zip codes in New York: risk ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.08-0.10). The risk of violent death and injury observed in the zip codes studied was almost entirely borne by individuals from minoritized racial and ethnic groups: Black and Hispanic males represented 96.2% of those who were fatally shot (452 individuals) and 97.3% of those who experienced nonfatal injury (1636 individuals) across the 4 settings studied.Conclusions and RelevanceIn this cross-sectional study, for young adult men in several of the communities studied, firearm violence carried morbidity and mortality risks that exceeded those of war. Health equity requires prioritizing effective responses."
Factors influencing injury or death due to traumatic events in Afghanistan's crisis-affected populations: a cross-sectional nationwide study,"Jin-Won Noh, Lena J Lee, Kyoung-Beom Kim, Jiho Cha, Young Dae Kwon",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-063329,2022-12-5,['Yonsei University Mirae Campus'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Peace Initiatives', 'Nutrition', 'Disease Prevention']",,"The article explores injury mortality in crisis-affected populations in Afghanistan, a nation with a long history of conflict and displacement issues. It aims to address the lack of comprehensive data on injury-related deaths among Afghan populations affected by war, violence, natural disasters, and other crises, highlighting a significant human rights concern regarding the well-being and safety of these vulnerable groups.

The purpose of the research is to identify risk factors for injuries and death in Afghanistan’s crisis-affected populations. The study specifically investigates how major events such as violent conflicts and natural disasters contribute to injury and mortality rates, thus addressing the broader human rights challenges of access to healthcare and safe living conditions.

The research involved a descriptive analysis based on the Whole of Afghanistan Assessment (WoAA) 2019. It was a large household survey using a random cluster sample of 31,343 displaced and shock-affected households spread across Afghanistan’s 34 provinces. The study used multivariable Poisson regression analysis to determine the association between injury or death and factors like distance from healthcare facilities and experience of major traumatic events.

Key findings indicate a high prevalence of injuries and deaths related to major conflicts, earthquakes, floods, and other environmental disasters. Households far from healthcare facilities were significantly more likely to experience injury or death. The study highlights stark inequities in the distribution of healthcare resources, with crisis-affected populations lacking adequate access to timely medical care.

The article discusses Afghanistan’s healthcare infrastructure, noting improvements over the years, yet pointing out significant gaps, especially for displaced populations. While coverage has increased, many still lack essential healthcare services, exacerbating injury risks.

Authors conclude by emphasizing the urgent need for strategies to prevent violence and conflict-related injuries, ensure healthcare access, and address both physical and mental health needs. They recommend integrating crisis-affected populations into healthcare systems and improving service access as vital steps to reduce injury and death rates. The study underlines the importance of future research, including mixed-methods approaches, to understand better and address the complexities of injury mortality in these populations.

The study acknowledges several limitations, such as reliance on self-reported data, which might underestimate the actual injury burden due to stigma or recall bias. It also notes the inability to detail specific injury conditions, mechanisms, or socioeconomic factors, suggesting the need for further research to refine healthcare policies and interventions in Afghanistan.","ObjectiveAfghanistan, with one of the world’s largest refugee populations, suffers an enormous burden of injury resulting in loss of life. This study aims to identify the epidemiology of injuries or death in the crisis-affected populations across Afghanistan and to investigate factors associated with injuries or deaths due to traumatic events.DesignCross-sectional study.SettingThis study analysed Whole Afghanistan Assessment 2019 data. This survey geographically covered all 34 accessible provinces in Afghanistan.Participants31 343 displaced and shock-affected households in Afghanistan.Primary and secondary outcome measuresInjury or death of household members due to traumatic events.Results2561 (8.2%) reported at least one household member had been injured or deceased because of a significant conflict or natural disaster in the past year. Households experienced significant events such as active conflict or violence (prevalence ratio, PR=5.575, p&lt;0.001), earthquake (PR=3.118, p=0.004), flood (PR=1.534, p=0.008) and avalanche or heavy snowfall (PR=3.450, p&lt;0.001) were significantly associated with injury or death. The likelihood of injury or death was significantly higher for long-distance households than for households living within a 5 km radius of the nearest healthcare facilities (6–10 km: PR=1.402, p=0.030; &gt;10 km: PR=1.560, p=0.020).ConclusionThe study provides an epidemiological profile of injuries or death in crisis-affected populations across Afghanistan. Results also suggest that certain factors place the crisis-affected populations in Afghanistan at high risk for injuries or death, which can inform the development of surveillance and prevention programmes, the monitoring of patterns over time and the formulation of healthcare policies."
"Time-dependent suicide rates among Army soldiers returning from an Afghanistan/Iraq deployment, by military rank and component","Rachel Sayko Adams, Jeri E. Forster, Jaimie L. Gradus, Claire A. Hoffmire, Trisha A. Hostetter, Mary Jo Larson, Colin G. Walsh, Lisa A. Brenner",https://doi.org/10.1186/s40621-022-00410-9,2022-12-23,"['School of Public Health', 'Brandeis University', 'VHA Rocky Mountain Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center']",Article,1,Yes,"['Security and Conflict', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Veterans', 'Gender']",,"This article addresses the critical issue of elevated suicide rates among military members and veterans, particularly focusing on variations across different ranks and components of service. Here is a comprehensive summary based on the specified points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The article situates its research within the broader context of persistently higher suicide rates among military members and veterans compared to civilians. This disparity is deeply rooted in various social determinants of health such as socioeconomic status, rank-based disparities, and racial inequities within the military.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The research aims to analyze suicide rates post-deployment from Afghanistan/Iraq (2008-2014) across different military ranks and components. It highlights significant human rights concerns related to the mental health and well-being of military personnel and veterans, emphasizing the elevated suicide risk faced by Junior Enlisted soldiers.

3. **Research Methods**: The study employs a prospective analysis of trends in post-deployment suicide rates over an 11-year period. It considers various factors such as rank, deployment history, and service component to understand their association with suicide risk.

4. **Main Findings**: 
   - Junior Enlisted Army soldiers have the highest suicide rates and risk post-deployment, followed by Senior Enlisted/Warrant Officers.
   - The risk remains consistent across a decade, with rank as a significant factor influencing suicide rates due to its correlation with socioeconomic status and racial inequities.
   - No significant variation in suicide risk was observed by service component (Active Duty, National Guard, Reserve) except a noted increase for Active Duty members in the first 6.5 years post-deployment.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The study doesn't extensively detail the country's legal frameworks, but it implies the need for targeted mental health support and policy interventions, given the suicide risk disparities linked to rank and race.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that lower military rank is a critical determinant of suicide risk and suggest the implementation of comprehensive support systems for vulnerable groups. They also advocate for gender-sensitive suicide prevention strategies to address the unique challenges faced by female military members.

7. **Limitations**: Limitations include potential data gaps or underreporting related to military service separation, challenges in capturing gender-specific suicide trends due to a smaller female sample size, and the broader political and social sensitivities surrounding military service members' mental health issues.

The findings underscore the importance of addressing socioeconomic disparities and implementing inclusive support systems to mitigate suicide risk among military personnel and veterans.","Abstract
                Background
                To date, knowledge is limited regarding time-dependent suicide risk in the years following return from deployment and whether such rates vary by military rank (i.e., enlisted, officer) or component (i.e., active duty, National Guard, reserve). To address these gaps in knowledge, the objectives of this study were to determine and compare postdeployment suicide rates and trends (percent change over time), and hazard rates for Army soldiers, by rank and component (measured at the end of the deployment).
              
                Methods
                Longitudinal cohort study of 860,930 Army soldiers returning from Afghanistan/Iraq deployment in fiscal years 2008–2014 from the Substance Use and Psychological Injury Combat study. Death by suicide was observed from the end of the first deployment in the study period through 2018 (i.e., the most recently available mortality data) for up to 11 years of follow-up. Analyses were conducted in 2021–2022.
              
                Results
                Adjusting for age, lowest-ranking Junior Enlisted (E1–E4) soldiers had a suicide rate 1.58 times higher than Senior Enlisted (E5–E9)/Warrant Officers (95% CI [1.24, 2.01]) and 2.41 times higher than Officers (95% CI [1.78, 3.29]). Suicide rates among lower-ranking enlisted soldiers remained elevated for 11 years postdeployment. Overall and annual postdeployment suicide rates did not differ significantly across components. Comparisons across rank and component for females were generally consistent with the full cohort results.
              
                Conclusions
                Lower-ranking enlisted soldiers had the highest rate of suicide, underscoring the importance of understanding rank as it relates to social determinants of health. For over a decade following Afghanistan/Iraq deployment, lower-enlisted rank during deployment was associated with an elevated rate of suicide; thereby suggesting that postdeployment prevention interventions targeting lower-ranking military members are warranted.

Afghan women’s empowerment and antenatal care utilization: a population-based cross-sectional study,"Sarah Yeo, Melanie Bell, Yu Ri Kim, Halimatou Alaofè",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-05328-0,2022-12-27,['The University of Arizona'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Human Rights']","['Maternal Health', 'Gender', 'Gender Apartheid']",,"**Summary of the Article**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The article examines the association between women's empowerment and antenatal care (ANC) utilization in Afghanistan, noting the complex sociocultural landscape, including the influence of cultural practices like dowry on women's rights and empowerment.

2. **Research Purpose and Challenges:**
   The study aims to understand how various aspects of women's empowerment, such as education, decision-making, and access to information, correlate with ANC utilization, addressing challenges related to women's health rights and autonomy in Afghanistan's context.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study utilized data from the 2015 Afghan Demographic and Health Survey (AfDHS) to explore the relationship between women's empowerment indicators and ANC visits, focusing on individual-level variables due to data limitations.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - Positive associations were found between higher education, decision-making autonomy, media access, and increased ANC visits.
   - Employment and asset ownership had mixed results, with employment types affecting ANC access, highlighting the nuanced dimensions of empowerment.
   - The findings suggest that women's empowerment is complex and influenced by various cultural and contextual factors.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   While not deeply examined, cultural practices affecting legal rights, such as dowry (Mahr) and property rights, were discussed, indicating a need for policy interventions that enhance women's autonomy and health rights.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that promoting women's education and providing information could improve ANC utilization. They recommend policies to empower women through education, improve awareness of maternal health care, and support decision-making autonomy. Further research is needed to understand empowerment pathways better.

7. **Study Limitations:**
   Limitations include the inability to capture multidimensional empowerment fully, focusing on individual rather than broader economic, legal, or socio-political spheres. The study's reliance on available DHS data restricted analysis to certain empowerment aspects, and political instability in Afghanistan poses challenges in evaluating long-term impacts on women's empowerment and health care access.

Overall, the study highlights the complex relationship between women's empowerment and health care utilization, advocating for comprehensive strategies to enhance women's rights and health outcomes in Afghanistan.","Abstract
                Background
                Although antenatal care (ANC) offers a unique opportunity to diagnose and prevent complications by mitigating modifiable risk, 38.2% of women did not complete any ANC visits in Afghanistan in 2015. Women empowerment is associated with increased use of ANC; however, there is no evidence of the effect of women empowerment on ANC in the country. Addressing this gap, we aimed to evaluate the association between women’s empowerment and ANC utilization based on the conceptual framework of women’s empowerment.
              
                Methods
                We analyzed data from the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey for 11,056 women. The association between four domains of women’s empowerment, including capability, access to resources, security, and decision-making and power, and at least four ANC visits was analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression.
              
                Results
                After adjusting for covariates, access to information (AOR 1.38, 95%CI 1.24, 1.54) and decision-making (AOR 1.16, 95%CI 1.08, 1.24) were positively associated with four or more ANC visits. Compared to those without any education, women with primary education (AOR 1.67, 95%CI 1.02, 2.72), secondary education (AOR 2.43, 95%CI 1.25, 4.70), and higher education (AOR 3.03, 95%CI 1.30, 7.07) had higher odds of least four ANC visits. However, asset ownership was negatively associated with ANC visits (AOR 0.72, 95%CI 0.56, 0.92). Variables related to security and literacy were not associated with the minimum ANC visits.
              
                Conclusions
                The mixed results of the study highlight the complex natures of women’s empowerment, warranting a more nuanced understanding of women’s empowerment in the context and future research that capture multidimensionality of women’s empowerment. Also, efforts to empower women, particularly those with no education and had less decision-making power and access to health information, could be an effective strategy to enhance ANC use in Afghanistan.

Telemedicine interventions in six conflict-affected countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region: a systematic review,"Pylin Parkes, Timesh D. Pillay, Yamama Bdaiwi, Remi Simpson, Nadim Almoshmosh, Lina Murad, Aula Abbara",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13031-022-00493-7,2022-12-14,"[""St Mary's Hospital""]",Review,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Technology', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Telemedicine', 'Digital Technology']",,"Certainly! Here is a structured summary of the article:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   - The research focuses on telemedicine interventions in conflict-affected regions, predominantly in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Gaza. These areas have been severely impacted by ongoing conflicts, resulting in a critical shortage of healthcare resources and personnel. Telemedicine is explored as a means to deliver healthcare remotely, where traditional services are disrupted.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   - The primary aim of the research is to evaluate the implementation of telemedicine interventions in conflict-affected settings. It addresses the human rights challenges of healthcare accessibility and quality in regions where infrastructure and medical personnel are scarce due to conflict.

3. **Research Methods:**
   - This study is a systematic review of 24 articles that include observational studies, commentaries, case reports, interventional studies, and cross-sectional studies. The data were analyzed using a conceptual framework adapted from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research by Damschoder et al.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - The research identified that telemedicine was employed across various specialties, addressing the lack of specialist healthcare workers. It leveraged technology such as image exchange, case discussions, and direct patient-provider interactions via electronic systems and social media applications. Key findings included diverse applications of telemedicine, the role of humanitarian organizations as facilitators, and technological barriers like limited internet bandwidth.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   - While the article does not delve deeply into specific legal frameworks, it acknowledges the role of humanitarian and academic organizations in facilitating these interventions. Collaboration with local and international partners suggests the necessity for supportive policies and frameworks to enable telemedicine in conflict zones.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - The authors conclude the need for sustained funding and resources to ensure the viability of telemedicine projects. They recommend strengthening technical infrastructure and addressing provider shortages through training and recruitment. Adoption of robust data management systems and policy development to support telemedicine are also crucial for success.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   - The study's limitations include variability in study quality, lack of statistical rigor, and challenges due to the political climate in conflict-affected regions. Data availability was often restricted, and technological barriers significantly affected the continuity and quality of interventions. The reliance on volunteers and limited funding were also noted as significant barriers to implementation.

This summary encapsulates the scope of the research, highlights key findings, and addresses the overarching challenges and recommendations for telemedicine in conflict-affected areas.","AbstractBackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has escalated the use of telemedicine in both high and low resource settings however its use has preceded this, particularly in conflict-affected settings. Several countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean (EMR) region are affected by complex, protracted crises. Though telemedicine has been used in such settings, there has been no comprehensive assessment of what interventions are used, their efficacy, barriers, or current research gaps.Main bodyA systematic search of ten academic databases and 3 grey literature sources from January 1st 2000 to December 31st 2020 was completed, identifying telemedicine interventions in select EMR conflict-affected settings and relevant enablers and barriers to their implementation. Included articles reported on telemedicine use in six conflict-affected EMR countries (or territories) graded as WHO Health Emergencies: Afghanistan, Gaza, Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen. Data were extracted and narratively synthesised due to heterogeneity in study design and outcomes. Of 3419 articles identified, twenty-one peer-reviewed and three grey literature sources met the inclusion criteria. We analysed these by context, intervention, and evaluation. Context: eight related to Afghanistan, eight to Syria and seven to Iraq with one each in Yemen and Gaza. Most were implemented by humanitarian or academic organisations with projects mostly initiated in the United States or Europe and mostly by physicians. The in-country links were mostly health professionals rather than patients seeking specialist inputs for specialities not locally available. Interventions: these included both SAF (store and forward) and RT (real-time) with a range of specialities represented including radiology, histopathology, dermatology, mental health, and intensive care. Evaluation: most papers were observational or descriptive with few describing quality measures of interventions.ConclusionsTelemedicine interventions are feasible in conflict-affected settings in EMR using low-cost, accessible technologies. However, few implemented interventions reported on evaluation strategies or had these built in. The ad hoc nature of some of the interventions, which relied on volunteers without sustained financial or academic investment, could pose challenges to quality and sustainability. There was little exploration of confidentiality, ethical standards, data storage or local healthcare worker and patient acceptability."

                  Background
                  Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of TB. We prospectively documented the treatment outcomes and the risk factors for death in children with TBM from Kandahar, Afghanistan.
               
               
                  Methods
                  This prospective observational cohort study was conducted from February 2017 to January 2020 in hospitalised TBM children. All the patients were prospectively followed up for 12 mo. Data were analysed by using descriptive statistics, χ2 and multivariate logistic regression.
               
               
                  Results
                  A total of 818 TBM hospitalised patients with median age 4.8 (0.8–14.5) y were recruited. Females accounted for 60.9% (498/818). Upon admission 53.9% (n=441) and 15.2% (n=124) had TBM stages II and III, respectively, and 23.2% (n=190) had focal neurological signs. The case fatality rate was 20.2% (160/794) and 30.6% (243/794) survived with neurological sequelae. Independent risk factors for death were being unvaccinated for BCG (adjusted OR [AOR] 3.8, 95% CI 1.8 to 8.1), not receiving dexamethasone (AOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.2), being male (AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.6), history of recent weight loss (AOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.9) and having stage III TBM (AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.3).
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  TBM continues to cause high morbidity and mortality in Afghan children. Strategies to reduce mortality should emphasise early diagnosis and treatment, routine use of dexamethasone and increased BCG vaccination.

"Examining bidirectional associations between perceived social support and psychological symptoms in the context of stressful event exposure: a prospective, longitudinal study","Sarah Thomas, Philipp Kanske, Judith Schäfer, Katrin Veronika Hummel, Sebastian Trautmann",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04386-0,2022-11-28,['Technische Universität Dresden'],Article,1,Yes,"['Security and Conflict', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Veterans', 'Disease Prevention']",,"**Summary of the Article:**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The study focuses on German soldiers deployed to Afghanistan, highlighting the relevance of military contexts where individuals are collectively exposed to stressful events. In such high-risk occupational settings, maintaining social cohesion is critical, aligning with military culture's emphasis on support and responsibility among soldiers.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The study aims to investigate the stability of perceived social support and its bidirectional relationship with psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD, particularly before and after exposure to stressful events.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The researchers conducted a longitudinal study with German soldiers, measuring perceived social support and psychological symptoms twice: before and after deployment to Afghanistan. The study focused on both general and workplace social support and analyzed the associations with psychiatric symptoms.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - Perceived general social support remained stable, while workplace social support slightly increased.
   - Higher perceived social support was associated with lower depressive symptoms, consistent with the stress-buffering model.
   - There was no significant association between perceived social support and PTSD symptoms.
   - Increased depressive and PTSD symptoms were linked to lower perceived social support, suggesting a vicious circle.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Institutions:**
   The study does not specifically examine legal frameworks, institutions, or policies related to human rights in Germany or Afghanistan.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that perceived social support is relatively stable but can serve as a protective factor against depression. They recommend interventions to enhance perceived social support prior to stress exposure and to monitor subclinical symptom levels to prevent worsening conditions. Training programs to enhance social abilities could be beneficial, especially for those with subclinical symptoms.

7. **Limitations:**
   - The study focused on perceptions, with no measure of objective social support.
   - Psychological symptoms reported were generally subclinical, limiting clinical inferences.
   - Small sample size and potential memory bias during follow-up may have affected results.
   - The unique characteristics of the military population may limit the generalizability.
   - German translations of some scales may have affected data reliability.
   - The time gap between deployment and follow-up might introduce unmeasured influences.

The authors suggest future studies should explore longitudinal associations over extended periods and devise interventions that cater specifically to the types of social support that align with individuals' psychological needs and symptoms.","AbstractBackgroundAfter stressful event exposure, higher perceived social support is a well-established correlate of decreased risk for psychological symptoms, including depressive, anxiety and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms. However, longitudinal data on the direction of this association and the stability of perceived social support are scarce and have yielded mixed results, with a particular lack of prospective studies. We aimed to investigate changes in perceived social support and bidirectional associations between perceived social support and psychological symptoms in a prospective, longitudinal study.MethodsA sample of German soldiers was assessed before and after deployment to Afghanistan. Group-based trajectory modelling was used to investigate the stability of perceived social support and to identify possible distinguishable trajectories of perceived social support. Bidirectional associations between perceived social support (general and workplace) and psychological symptoms (depressive, anxiety and PTS) were examined using gamma regressions.ResultsAverage levels of perceived general social support did not change, while perceived workplace social support increased slightly (t(344) = 5.51,p &lt; .001). There were no distinguishable trajectories of perceived social support. Higher perceived general (Mean ratio (MR) = 0.84, 95% CI = [0.74, 0.95]) and workplace social support (MR = 0.82, 95% CI = [0.72, 0.92]) predicted lower depressive symptoms, but not anxiety or PTS symptoms. Only higher PTS (MR = 0.95, 95% CI = [0.91, 0.99]) and higher depressive symptoms (MR = 0.96, 95% CI = [0.93, 0.99]) predicted lower perceived general social support.ConclusionsPerceived social support can remain relatively stable under exposure to environmental stressors such as military deployment. Higher perceived social support could protect against depressive symptoms via a stress-buffering mechanism, while support may need to be more tailored to individual needs for a protection against PTS symptoms. Individuals with elevated depressive and PTS symptoms might have impaired abilities or opportunities to access social support after stressful event exposure. Future studies could investigate distressing social emotions and associated maladaptive social cognitions as possible mechanisms in the association between symptoms and lower perceived social support. Especially with respect to PTS symptoms, future studies could focus on conditions that enable individuals to benefit from social support."
Taliban 2.0 and US National Security Policy in Afghanistan,Joshua Snider,https://doi.org/10.1177/23477970221129905,2022-11-24,['National Defense College of the United Arab Emirates'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"This article examines from the point of view of the US national security policy, the causes and contexts for the US exit from Afghanistan and the factors that will influence the US policy in Afghanistan in the coming decade. It reviews the logic behind post-9/11 US ‘grand strategy’ and the evolution of the US national security policy in this period, which included the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan. It examines the evolution of the US deployment and factors which complicated the US strategic objectives in Afghanistan, including the persistent tension in the US national security objectives between counter-terrorism and nation-building objectives. It argues that the US faces limited palatable options regarding its post-withdrawal Afghanistan policy and that moving forward, policy will be constrained by a mix of situational and structural variables. These include US domestic politics, the Taliban regime itself (and its relationship with ISIS-K) and the region’s geopolitical winds, notably the strategic positions of Iran, Pakistan, China and to a lesser extent Russia."

The aim of the research is to address the gaps and challenges in tackling viral hepatitis, a persistent global health threat, particularly due to insufficient healthcare infrastructure in Afghanistan.

1. **Context**: Afghanistan, ranked the second least developed country globally, suffers from a fragile healthcare system due to decades of war. The country's health challenges are compounded by political instability, particularly following the Taliban's takeover, which stunted international aid and affected healthcare delivery.

2. **Purpose**: The research aims to address the void in data and effective healthcare response to viral hepatitis within the context of Afghanistan's socio-political climate and health emergencies like COVID-19. It highlights the simultaneous health burden of hepatitis alongside the pandemic.

3. **Methods**: The study relies on data from Kabul's Infectious Disease Hospital, WHO reports, and other epidemiological evidence to assess the status and response to viral hepatitis amid the COVID-19 context.

4. **Findings**: The study notes the high prevalence and transmission risks of HBV and HCV, highlighting that the country's medical services are inadequate, evident in rising hepatitis cases and poor healthcare accessibility. Over 3945 cases were documented in 2019, decreasing to 2706 in 2020 due partially to pandemic disruptions.

5. **Legal and Institutional Exploration**: The research underscores efforts put into establishing healthcare systems like DEWS and HMIS. However, these systems remain under-optimized due to infrastructural and operational challenges, worsened by sanctions and reduced international support post-Taliban.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors emphasize the need for enhancing health infrastructure, surveillance, and public awareness geared toward hepatitis prevention and control. They advocate for policy implementation leveraging WHO guidelines, improving vaccination coverage, enhancing medical equipment hygiene, and reinforcing international investment despite the challenging political climate.

7. **Limitations**: Significant limitations include the unavailability of comprehensive data, the restricted scope of healthcare services due to political crises, and inadequate funding, all of which impede sustainable healthcare solutions. The sensitivity surrounding hepatitis and other human rights within Afghanistan's unstable political climate presents additional methodological challenges.

Overall, the article sheds light on the urgent need for reinforced healthcare strategies in Afghanistan to combat viral hepatitis amidst prevailing socio-political and health challenges.",No abstract available

Women empowerment and access to maternity and reproductive healthcare in Pakistan: cross-validation of a Survey-based Index in Afghanistan (SWEI-A),"Omid Dadras, Mohammadyasin Dadras, Leila Jafari, Takeo Nakayama, Fateme Dadras",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-022-02031-2,2022-11-16,"['Western Norway University of Applied Sciences', 'Universitetet i Bergen']",Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Gender', 'Maternal Health', 'Traditional Practices']",,"**Summary of the Article:**

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   Pakistan and Afghanistan share deep historical ties, traditional similarities, and common ethnocultural and religious identities. Both countries exhibit longstanding patriarchal norms that contribute to women's rights violations, positioning women in underprivileged societal roles and affecting their autonomy and decision-making capabilities. Efforts to enhance women's empowerment are critical to addressing these issues and promoting women's participation in societal development.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges Addressed:**
   The study aims to adapt a previously developed women's empowerment index from Afghanistan to a context-specific version for Pakistan (SWEI-P), focusing on measuring empowerment among married women aged 15–49 years. It addresses the challenge of quantifying women's empowerment across several domains—key in promoting women's rights and improving their autonomy in health and life decisions.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study utilized a 6-factor model adapted from the original 7-factor Afghan model, excluding property-owning, for Pakistani women. This model was validated for internal consistency and construct validity. The convergence validity was also tested through associations with four indicators of reproductive and maternity care, revealing strong correlations and supporting the model's validity.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The adapted 6-domain index effectively reflects women's empowerment in Pakistan. It demonstrated significant associations with favorable reproductive and maternity outcomes. Contrary to Afghanistan, property-owning did not significantly correlate with empowerment outcomes in Pakistan. This may be due to cultural practices like dowry where property ownership does not equate to empowerment.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies Examination:**
   While the study doesn't deeply delve into specific legal frameworks, it highlights the cultural and socio-political context influencing women's empowerment and suggests the potential influence of policy interventions informed by such an index.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that the newly developed SWEI-P is a reliable tool for assessing women's empowerment among married women in Pakistan. It holds importance for policy-making and future research. To ensure relevance over time, continual updates reflecting evolving social norms and cultural changes are recommended.

7. **Study Limitations:**
   The study faces limitations such as potential biases from self-reported data and exclusion of single, widowed, divorced, and separated women in the index, as it focuses only on married women. Additionally, cultural variations in perceptions of women’s empowerment are not fully addressed, and the socio-economic dynamics may change over time, affecting the relevance of the empowerment measure.

Overall, the study presents an important step toward understanding and enhancing women's empowerment in Pakistan through a context-specific approach, while acknowledging the cultural and methodological constraints involved.","Abstract
                Background
                Despite the obvious violation of women’s rights in Pakistan and the vital necessity for women empowerment, a unified country-specific index measuring women empowerment is not yet available. This study cross-validated a survey-based women empowerment index from Afghanistan to be used in Pakistan.
              
                Methods
                The data for married Pakistani women aged 15–49 in the 2017–18 Pakistan demographic health survey was used to construct the final model using the explanatory and confirmatory factor analyses. The Cronbach’s alpha test examined the internal consistency of the developed index. To assess the convergence validity of the index, the association of each emerged domain with indicators of access to reproductive and maternity care was assessed by Poisson regression analysis adjusting for wealth index.
              
                Results
                The final index had six domains; namely, labor force participation, attitude toward violence, decision-making, access to healthcare, literacy, age at critical life events predicting women empowerment of married Pakistani women with decent reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.70), and validity (SRSEA&amp;SRMR &lt; 0.05, CFI&amp;TLI &gt; 0.92). The emerged domains were significantly associated with at least one of four indicators for access to reproductive and maternity care; indicative of a favorable convergence validity.
              
                Conclusion
                Pakistan and Afghanistan are associated as brother countries with shared religious and ethnocultural identities in which women are perceived inferior to men and in critical need of empowering efforts. The results of this study reflect upon this resemblance in sociocultural structure by yielding similar domains for women's empowerment in Pakistan building upon an index previously developed for Afghan women. The developed index could inform the design of future policies, interventions, and research recognizing the important indicators of women empowerment in Pakistan and could enhance the comparability of the results across future studies.

For over 20 years, Moscow was observing the strategic rise of the fundamentalist militant movement with concern, which was largely triggered by domestic security considerations as well as potential challenges to security and stability across the former Soviet Central Asia. However, since the re-establishment of the Taliban’s rule in Kabul, Moscow’s approach underwent a gradual change, from being negative and alarmist to a more cautiously pragmatic one. This article will review the evolution of Russia’s perceptions of the Taliban, highlight Moscow’s principal concerns, identify the initial set of response measures following the country’s takeover in 2021 and entertain several scenarios of the Kremlin’s future approaches vis-a-vis the new rulers in Kabul.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The study examines lead exposure (LE) as a significant public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) within the North Africa and Middle East (NAME) region. From 1990 to 2019, LE's health burden decreased slightly, yet disparities remain, notably between high and low Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) countries. Environmental and industrial factors, such as informal battery recycling and metal processing, significantly contribute to LE in these regions, complicating reduction efforts.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges:**
   The research assesses the public health impact of LE, focusing on human rights issues like the right to health. It addresses challenges in managing LE's health impacts, particularly among vulnerable populations in LMICs where the legal frameworks and institutional controls might be weak.

3. **Research Methods Used:**
   The study analyzes Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 data, investigating age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to LE across the NAME region. It utilizes complex modeling strategies and relies on a variety of data sources from 1990 to 2019.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - There was a 36.8% reduction in the age-standardized DALY rate due to LE in the NAME region from 1990 to 2019. However, disparities increased, with Afghanistan, Yemen, and Sudan suffering the highest rates.
   - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and chronic kidney diseases (CKDs) were the primary contributors to DALYs due to LE.
   - High SDI countries had lower attributable burdens compared to low SDI countries.
   - LE was notably higher in LMICs, where more than 62% of DALYs for certain diseases were attributable to LE.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   The study highlights the success of regulatory actions in reducing LE in high-income countries but notes the ineffectiveness or absence of similar regulations in LMICs. It underscores the need for tailored strategies considering local lead exposure sources, unlike more universal sources such as paint and gasoline addressed in high-income countries.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors recommend cost-effective preventative strategies against LE-related health risks, potentially involving a combination of education and poverty reduction. They call for national and international collaboration to design interventions tailored to LMIC contexts, given the rapid industrialization and peculiar LE sources.

7. **Limitations:**
   Key limitations include the political climate and data availability in LMICs, impacting the study's comprehensiveness. The quality and completeness of primary data were often insufficient, and there were methodological challenges due to varied data collection practices across different regions and times. Limited exposure data from the countries classified as LMICs further constrained the analysis.

The study ultimately underscores the need for targeted public health interventions and legal reforms in LMICs to mitigate the adverse health impacts of lead exposure.","Abstract
                Background
                Lead exposure (LE) and its attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) have declined in the recent decade; however, it remains one of the leading public health concerns, particularly in regions with low socio-demographic index (SDI) such as the North Africa and Middle East (NAME) region. Hence, we aimed to describe the attributable burden of the LE in this region.
              
                Methods
                Data on deaths, DALYs, years of life lost (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) attributable to LE in the NAME region and its 21 countries from 1990 to 2019 were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study.
              
                Results
                In 2019, the age-standardized death and DALY rates attributable to LE were 23.4 (95% uncertainty interval: 15.1 to 33.3) and 489.3 (320.5 to 669.6) per 100,000 in the region, respectively, both of which were higher among men than women. The overall age-standardized death and DALY rates showed 27.7% and 36.8% decreases, respectively, between 1990 and 2019. In this period, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey had the highest decreases in the age-standardized death and DALY rates, while Afghanistan, Egypt, and Yemen had the lowest ones. Countries within high SDI quintile had lower attributable burden to LE compared with the low SDI quintile. Cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney diseases accounted for the 414.2 (258.6 to 580.6) and 28.7 (17.7 to 41.7) LE attributable DALYs per 100,000 in 2019, respectively. The attributable YLDs was 46.4 (20.7 to 82.1) per 100,000 in 2019, which shows a 25.7% reduction (-30.8 to -22.5%) over 1990–2019.
              
                Conclusions
                The overall LE and its attributed burden by cause have decreased in the region from 1990–2019. Nevertheless, the application of cost-effective and long-term programs for decreasing LE and its consequences in NAME is needed.

"Testing the Limits of Human Rights’ Dynamism: A Comparative Study of Afghan Women’s Rights Under the Taliban Regimes (1996, 2021)",Maryam Jami,https://doi.org/10.1177/09749284221127786,2022-10-20,['University of Pittsburgh'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available," While the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) deems human rights as universal and uniformly applicable to all societies, John Rawls’s idea of rights offers a narrower account of human rights which would be differential and acceptable to different societies and people. The notion emphasises that human rights move on a spectrum of continual development with regard to particularities and changing needs of different societies. Such an approach to human rights, Rawls argues, leads to better implementation of international human rights. Rawls’s analysis of human rights’ dynamic nature, however, remains confined only to macro-level variation of human rights among different societies. This article argues that human rights also vary within the same society. It charts how Afghan women’s conception of human rights has evolved from one period of the Taliban rule to another. This evolution indicates how, with the passage of time and the effect of external factors, new variants of women’s rights have emerged and became fundamental to the Afghan society. The article suggests that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) should not ignore this evolution and development. Rather, it can seize the opportunity to cooperate with the international community and foreign powers to implement women’s rights within a middle framework between human rights notions of Rawls and the UDHR.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**:
   The article is situated within the context of improving child health and civil rights, using historical data from various child health surveys like the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS). These surveys are significant as they have been conducted globally since the mid-1990s and offer a comprehensive dataset addressing the status of child health and welfare in over 121 countries.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions**:
   The research aims to study the relationship between birth registration coverage (BRC) and household headship, specifically analyzing how the sex of the head of household impacts BRC. A key human rights issue addressed here is ensuring necessary legal documentation and rights for children through proper birth registration.

3. **Research Methods**:
   The study used data from 93 countries with surveys conducted in 2010 or later, focusing on households with children under one year of age. Methods involved classifying household headship into three categories: male-headed (MHH), female-headed with an adult male present (FHH any male), and female-headed without an adult male (FHH no male). Statistical analyses, including Poisson regression for prevalence ratios and a meta-analytic approach, were used to analyze these categories' impact on BRC while adjusting for socio-economic factors.

4. **Main Findings**:
   The study discovered variations in BRC based on the sex of the household head. Generally, the prevalence of birth registration was lower in female-headed households, particularly those without a male present. This highlights a trend of potential disadvantage for children in these households regarding accessing essential legal documentation.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**:
   While the article does not deeply explore specific legal frameworks, it implicitly critiques the current systems by highlighting the disparities in BRC related to household types, emphasizing the need for inclusive and comprehensive registration policies.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**:
   The authors conclude that birth registration is essential for safeguarding children's rights and that significant disparities exist based on household headship. They recommend targeted policy interventions to improve BRC, especially in female-headed households without a male present, to ensure equitable access to civil registration services for all children.

7. **Limitations**:
   The study acknowledges limitations related to data availability and potential biases due to oversimplified household classifications. The political climate and social norms in surveyed countries might also influence household participation and data reporting, impacting the generalizability of findings. Furthermore, the sensitivity surrounding gender roles and household dynamics may affect both reported and analyzed outcomes.","Abstract
                Background
                Within-country inequalities in birth registration coverage (BRC) have been documented according to wealth, place of residence and other household characteristics. We investigated whether sex of the head of household was associated with BRC.
              
                Methods
                Using data from nationally-representative surveys (Demographic and Health Survey or Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey) from 93 low and middle-income countries (LMICs) carried out in 2010 or later, we developed a typology including three main types of households: male-headed (MHH) and female-led with or without an adult male resident. Using Poisson regression, we compared BRC for children aged less than 12 months living the three types of households within each country, and then pooled results for all countries. Analyses were also adjusted for household wealth quintiles, maternal education and urban-rural residence.
              
                Results
                BRC ranged from 2.2% Ethiopia to 100% in Thailand (median 79%) while the proportion of MHH ranged from 52.1% in Ukraine to 98.3% in Afghanistan (median 72.9%). In most countries the proportion of poor families was highest in FHH (no male) and lowest in FHH (any male), with MHH occupying an intermediate position. Of the 93 countries, in the adjusted analyses, FHH (no male) had significantly higher BRC than MHH in 13 countries, while in eight countries the opposite trend was observed. The pooled analyses showed t BRC ratios of 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00; 1.01) for FHH (any male) relative to MHH, and also 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00; 1.01) for FHH (no male) relative to MHH. These analyses also showed a high degree of heterogeneity among countries.
              
                Conclusion
                Sex of the head of household was not consistently associated with BRC in the pooled analyses but noteworthy differences in different directions were found in specific countries. Formal and informal benefits to FHH (no male), as well as women’s ability to allocate household resources to their children in FHH, may explain why this vulnerable group has managed to offset a potential disadvantage to their children.

1. **Context**: Afghanistan has experienced enduring political conflict, economic upheaval, and disruptions in social institutions, exacerbated by the Taliban's return to power in 2021. These factors have contributed to widespread poverty, unemployment, and mental health challenges, including heightened rates of psychiatric disorders such as PTSD.

2. **Purpose**: The research seeks to address the mental health crisis in Afghanistan and explores the high prevalence of suicidal behavior, assessing its associations with psychiatric disorders and trauma, including sexual violence.

3. **Methodology**: As the largest psychiatric epidemiological study in Afghanistan, the research utilized cross-sectional data collection methods to examine associations between suicidal behaviors and various risk factors.

4. **Findings**: The study found significant associations between suicidal behavior and trauma, with women experiencing higher rates than men. Mental disorders such as anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders are strongly linked to suicidal behaviors. The results show that the burden of mental health issues in Afghanistan is greater compared to other low- to middle-income countries.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The study indicates considerable gaps in Afghanistan's mental health infrastructure, exacerbated by the cessation of international aid and increased political instability, leading to underfunded mental health services.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors recommend enhancing mental health support systems and international relief efforts that include mental health treatment. They also stress the need for continuous data surveillance to track mental health trends.

7. **Limitations**: The study's limitations include its cross-sectional design, reliance on self-reported data, and lack of longitudinal tracking or consideration of all possible risk factors, compounded by the challenging political climate that affects data collection and healthcare provisions.","Abstract
                Background
                The role of traumatic event exposure and psychiatric disorders as central risk factors for suicidal behavior has been established, but there are limited data in high conflict regions with significant trauma exposures such as Afghanistan.
              
                Methods
                A nationally representative, cross-sectional survey was conducted through systematic stratified random sampling in 8 regions of Afghanistan in 2017 (N = 4474). Well-validated instruments were used to establish trauma exposure, psychiatric disorders. Death preference, suicidal ideation, plan, and attempts were assessed.
              
                Results
                In the total sample, 2.2% reported suicidal ideation in the past 12 months, and 7.1% of respondents reported that they had suicidal ideation at some point in their lives; 3.4% reported a suicide attempt. Women were at higher risk than men. All traumatic event exposures were strongly associated with suicidal behavior. Respondents who reported experiencing sexual violence were 4.4 times more likely to report lifetime suicide attempts (95% CI 2.3–8.4) and 5.8 times more likely to report past 12-month suicidal ideation (95% CI 2.7–12.4). Associations were strong and significant for all psychiatric disorders related to suicidal behavior. Respondents who met criteria for major depressive episodes (OR = 7.48; 95% CI 4.40–12.72), generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 6.61; 95% CI 3.54–12.33), and PTSD (OR = 7.26; 95% CI 4.21–12.51) had the highest risk of past 12-month suicidal ideation.
              
                Conclusion
                Traumatic event exposures and psychiatric disorders increase risk of suicidal behavior in the Afghan general population; women are at high risk. Interventions to reduce trauma exposure, including expansion of a mental health workforce in the region, are critically important.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The study examines the burden of chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) in the NAME region over the period from 1990 to 2019. During these years, the region experienced significant socioeconomic changes, increased urbanization, and industrial development, contributing to environmental pollution and lifestyle changes that affect health.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research aims to analyze trends in the incidence, prevalence, and impact of CRDs in the NAME region. It addresses human rights challenges related to health, particularly focusing on addressing and reducing risk factors such as smoking, pollution, and access to healthcare in order to mitigate CRD-related health disparities.

3. **Research Methods Used:**
   The study utilizes data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study, employing systematic data collection and methodology to estimate the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of CRDs in the NAME region.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of CRDs increased by 10.3% between 1990 and 2019, while the age-standardized DALYs rate declined significantly by 26.4%.
   - Asthma is the most prevalent CRD in the region, with smoking remaining the leading risk factor for men. Household and ambient particulate pollution and high BMI are significant risk factors for women.
   - The burden of CRDs is notably high among people aged 80 and over, and among young children due to factors like parental smoking.
   - Pneumoconiosis trends indicate occupational health disparities, with increasing incidence among women and changing patterns of occupational exposures.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies:**
   The article suggests that governmental action is necessary to address occupational risk factors, improve work environments, and implement tobacco control measures. It highlights the need for improved healthcare access and systematic policy responses to reduce risk factors such as smoking and obesity.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors call for comprehensive strategies to control CRDs, including reducing smoking through tax policies and public education, improving air quality, and enhancing healthcare facilities. They emphasize the importance of addressing high BMI and urbanization effects.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   - Data limitations necessitated the use of imputation methods, affecting the reliability of some results.
   - A lack of standardized definitions for CRDs across countries and inadequate diagnostic equipment in some regions hinder accurate data collection.
   - The challenge of accounting for confounders like air pollution and smoking in the analysis.

The research underlines the critical need for continued investment in public health and policy interventions to address the growing burden of CRDs in the NAME region, with a particular focus on vulnerable populations like children and the elderly.","Abstract
                Background
                North Africa and Middle East (NAME) has an increasing burden of chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs); however, a systematic understanding of the distribution and trends is not available. We aimed to report the trends of CRDs and attributable risk factors in this region between 1990 and 2019.
              
                Methods
                Using data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study (GBD) 2019, cause specific mortality served as the basis for estimating incidence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The burden attributable to risk factors was calculated by a comparative risk assessment and contribution of population ageing and growth was determined by decomposition analysis.
              
                Results
                The number of deaths due to CRD in 2019 were 128,513 (110,781 to 114,351). In 2019, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of CRDs was 1052.8 (924.3 to 1209.4) per 100,000 population and had a 10.3% increase and the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) was 36.1 (30.9 to 40.3) with a 32.9% decrease compared to 1990. In 2019, United Arab Emirates had the highest ASIR (1412.7 [1237.3 to 1622.2]) and Afghanistan had the highest ASDR (67.8 [52.0 to 81.3]). CRDs were responsible for 2.91% of total DALYs in 2019 (1.69% due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and 1.02% due to asthma). With regard to the components of DALYs, the age-standardized rate of years of life lost (YLL) had a − 39.0% (− 47.1 to − 30.3) decrease; while the age-standardized rate of years lived with disability (YLD) had a 13.4% (9.5 to 17.7) increase. Of total ASDRs of CRDs, 31.6% were attributable to smoking and 14.4% to ambient particulate matter pollution.
              
                Conclusion
                CRDs remain a leading cause of death and disability in NAME, with growth in absolute numbers. COPD and asthma were the most common CRDs and smoking was the leading risk factor especially in men. More attention is needed in order to reduce CRDs’ burden through appropriate interventions and policies.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The study focuses on South Asia, a region characterized by slower healthcare spending growth compared to developed countries, despite recent increases in expenditure. This region faces significant challenges such as high rates of adolescent fertility and low female literacy, which have critical impacts on maternal and neonatal health.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research aims to address human rights challenges related to maternal and neonatal mortality in South Asia by examining the impacts of healthcare spending, adolescent female fertility, and female literacy on health outcomes.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study uses retrospective data from 1990 to 2020 and employs panel data analysis, with some health outcomes estimated using imputation methods due to incomplete observations.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - Increased healthcare spending per capita correlates with reduced maternal and neonatal mortality.
   - Higher female literacy rates are associated with lower maternal and neonatal mortality rates.
   - High adolescent female fertility rates increase the risk of maternal and neonatal mortality, with early marriage (before age 18) contributing to these risks.
   - A sufficient number of healthcare providers per population is crucial, affecting neonatal and, to some extent, maternal mortality.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   The study highlights the discrepancy between existing laws and human rights frameworks against early marriage and the reality of high adolescent fertility in South Asia, suggesting a need for stronger enforcement and initiatives to delay marriage age.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that enhancing healthcare spending, female literacy, and delaying marriage age are vital for improving maternal and neonatal health in South Asia. They recommend increased governmental efforts and programmatic initiatives to address these areas effectively.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The study's limitations include incomplete health outcome data for some South Asian countries, reliance on imputation methods, and potential biases introduced by the purchasing power parity process. These limitations suggest caution when interpreting the results within the broader political and economic context of South Asia.","Abstract
                Background
                Maternal and neonatal mortality is high in South Asia. Recent studies have identified factors such as adolescent female fertility, healthcare spending is reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of adolescent female fertility and healthcare spending on maternal and neonatal mortality in South Asian countries.
              
                Methods
                A retrospective panel study design was used, a total of 8 South Asian countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) data from World development indicator 1990–2020 considered for analysis. Descriptive statistical method was used for summary. The effect of adolescent female fertility and healthcare spending on maternal and neonatal mortality were analysed using fixed and random effect regression with multiple imputation.
              
                Findings
                Adolescent female fertility, maternal, and neonatal mortality is very high in the aforementioned countries, and considerably varies among countries. A significant relationship between the maternal mortality and healthcare spending, neonatal mortality and adolescent female fertility was observed. We found neonatal and maternal mortality are more likely to decrease depends on healthcare spending. Healthcare spending has a significantly negative effect on neonatal mortality (− 0.182, 95% CI: [− 0.295 to −.069]; P-value &lt; 0.01) and maternal mortality (− 0.169, 95% CI: [− 0.243 to − 0.028]; P-value &lt; 0.05). A change in 1 % increases in healthcare spending should decrease by 0.182 neonatal mortality per 1000 live births and maternal mortality by 0.169 per 100,000 live births.
              
                Conclusions
                In south Asian countries, increasing healthcare spending and decreasing adolescent female fertility may contribute to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality. In addition, number of service providers such as physicians supplied contributed to the decline of neonatal mortality. These findings have important implications for future improvement of healthcare spending in maternal and neonatal health programs.

Understanding injecting drug use in Afghanistan: A scoping review,"Frishta Nafeh, Sufiat Fusigboye, Bundit Sornpaisarn",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13011-022-00491-1,2022-9-19,['Queen’s University'],Review,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Human Rights']","['Disease Prevention', 'Migration']",,"This article reviews patterns of injecting drug use (IDU) among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Afghanistan, highlighting significant human rights concerns and health challenges.

1. **Historical and Social Context**: Afghanistan has been deeply affected by years of conflict, affecting social structures and contributing to a refugee crisis. Many Afghan PWID have experienced displacement, often living temporarily in neighboring countries like Iran and Pakistan, where some began drug use.

2. **Research Purpose and Human Rights Questions**: The research aims to understand drug use patterns amongst Afghan PWID, focusing on risks of HIV/AIDS transmission and access to harm reduction services. It highlights human rights issues such as stigma, discrimination, and inadequate access to healthcare for PWID.

3. **Research Methods**: The review involved analyzing existing literature and studies on Afghan PWID, emphasizing patterns, health consequences, and service access based on available data.

4. **Main Findings**: Afghan PWID face severe HIV transmission risks due to low levels of condom use and needle sharing, with 87% of users engaging in such behaviors. Additionally, low HIV knowledge exacerbates these risks. Health service access is severely limited, often hindered by stigma, discrimination, and police harassment.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: Afghanistan struggles with providing adequate drug treatment and harm reduction services. High rates of incarceration among PWID highlight the need for prison-based interventions.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors recommend enhanced research and monitoring of drug use trends, acknowledging a gender gap in current research. They advocate for building local research capacity and international collaboration to improve evidence-based interventions for PWID.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: Limitations include a focus on English-language studies, potential data gaps, and specific challenges conducting research in Afghanistan due to political instability. There's also a lack of data on rural and female PWID, underestimating the full extent of IDU issues in the country.

The study underscores the urgent need for comprehensive harm reduction programs, better understanding of drug use patterns, and increased resource allocation to address both health and human rights challenges faced by PWID in Afghanistan.","Abstract
                Background
                Several reports have described a growing prevalence of illicit drug use in Afghanistan, with recognition of a recent shift from traditional modes of consumption involving inhalation and oral ingestion to injecting drug use.
              
                Objective
                Conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature to map the injecting drug use situation in Afghanistan. The review intends to describe risk factors and impacts of injecting drug use, drug use characteristics and risk behaviours among people who inject drugs (PWID), and access to harm reduction and treatment.
              
                Methods
                We searched Embase, Global Health, Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and grey literature to identify English language publications up to March 26th, 2022. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they explicitly targeted PWID or injecting drug use in Afghanistan and provided information relevant to the review questions. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion and extracted information based on the review objectives.
              
                Results
                A total of 25 articles were identified representing 15 studies (11 quantitative, 2 qualitative, 2 mixed methods). All but one studies were cross-sectional. In majority of the studies, over 95% of the participants were male and most were conducted over a decade ago, in urban settings, mainly Kabul. Only one study examined risk factors of injecting drug use. Eleven studies described drug use characteristics and 9 reported risk behaviours among PWID. Health and social burden of injecting drug use were reported by 8 and 5 studies, respectively. Nine studies described access to harm reduction and treatment. Afghan PWID had high levels of injecting and sexual risk behaviours compared to global estimates. They reported high prevalence of incarceration and displacement. Access to harm reduction and treatment was very limited. This scoping review revealed important knowledge gaps including a gender gap in research with serious implications for drug policy and substance use care.
              
                Conclusions
                Development of a national public health-oriented drug policy and substance use care programme is warranted along with efforts to develop health research capacity to address the need for epidemiological data. The current humanitarian crisis necessitates continued access to evidence-based harm reduction and treatment in Afghanistan.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The article stems from the context of Afghanistan's dependency on international support for its economic, healthcare, and social systems over the past decades. With the recent withdrawal of international assistance, Afghanistan faces critical challenges in stabilizing these sectors, especially considering the pressing socioeconomic situation exacerbated by decades of conflict.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research aims to explore how Afghanistan can utilize billions in frozen international assets to rebuild and stabilize its economy, healthcare system, and improve the rights of women and children. It emphasizes Afghanistan's right to financial independence and self-sustenance while addressing urgent human rights challenges.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study appears to be a qualitative analysis based on existing reports and expert opinions, focusing on strategic financial redeployment to critical sectors. While the article does not detail specific methodological approaches, it implies a review of feasible uses for unlocked assets to expedite financial independence and development.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The research identifies several critical areas needing attention: revitalizing the crippled healthcare system by funding organizations like Sehatmandi, improving maternal and child health, and ensuring nutritional sufficiency. It highlights the severe impact of the depreciated healthcare system on vulnerable populations, particularly women and children. Furthermore, it emphasizes the necessity of ensuring women and children have educational and vocational opportunities free from gender inequality, underpinning their central role in Afghanistan’s prosperity.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   While the article does not deeply delve into the country's legal frameworks, it underscores the importance of safeguarding women's rights and educational access within the current regime, suggesting that these funds be used to influence policies and protect these groups' rights.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that unlocking and strategically utilizing the frozen assets is crucial for Afghanistan's immediate and long-term needs. They recommend prioritizing funding for healthcare, microcredit programs, and educational initiatives, particularly for women and children, through organizations like the Afghan Women’s Network. By aligning financial strategies with human rights imperatives, Afghanistan can secure a more stable and equitable future.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The article acknowledges the complex political climate and the potential difficulty in ensuring nondiscrimination within educational and healthcare services given cultural contexts. Moreover, there is an implicit limitation in the availability of accurate data due to the country’s ongoing instability and the sensitivity of intervening in human rights within Afghanistan’s current political environment.","Abstract
                Background
                The current humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan started after the US and international allies’ withdrawal. This has put the country in a dire situation as the globalized infrastructure supporting Afghanistan came to halt. Moreover, 10 billion USD of Afghanistan’s assets were frozen by the U.S and other international organizations after the Taliban takeover. This further exacerbated the humanitarian crisis and quickened the economic collapse in Afghanistan. These assets should be freed to support the people of Afghanistan.
              
                Main body
                In order to address this situation, international oversight is needed to allow these funds to be returned and used by the Central Bank of Afghanistan without misappropriation by the Taliban. We suggest a number of short term interventions and long term considerations to improve the situation in Afghanistan with the $10 billion in frozen assets. In the short term, economic stability and the hunger crisis should be addressed by funding international organizations such as the World Food Program and national Afghani NGOs. In the long term funds should be used to build back the economy, build healthcare infrastructure, and support the development of women and children.
              
                Conclusion
                At this juncture, the world and international organizations have a moral and ethical responsibility to ensure the 10 billion in funds go to the owners, the people of Afghanistan. With oversight and fund distribution to the right partners, progress can be made by providing support in security, healthcare, education and food resources. This calls for action to deliver $10 billion of assets to the Afghan people in a transparent manner, avoiding further tension and disasters in the country.

Prevalence and geo-clinicodemographic factors associated with hepatitis B vaccination among healthcare workers in five developing countries,"Precious Adade Duodu, Ernest Darkwah, Pascal Agbadi, Henry Ofori Duah, Jerry John Nutor",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-022-07556-3,2022-7-7,['University of Huddersfield'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Education']","['Disease Prevention', 'Gender']",,"1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The study compares hepatitis B vaccination coverage among healthcare workers (HCWs) across five countries: Afghanistan, Haiti, Malawi, Nepal, and Senegal. These countries vary significantly in terms of economic development, healthcare infrastructure, and political stability, which may influence healthcare policy implementations such as vaccination programs. For instance, hepatitis B vaccine was only included in Haiti's national immunization schedule in 2012, which is reflected in their current low vaccination rates.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions:**
   The research aims to identify challenges and disparities in the hepatitis B vaccination coverage among HCWs in the selected countries. It addresses the crucial human rights issue of ensuring healthcare workers are protected from infectious diseases given their exposure risks, and examines inequalities based on gender, education, and professional qualifications.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study utilized nationally representative health facilities datasets, employing logistic regression models to analyze factors associated with hepatitis B vaccination among HCWs. These factors included gender, years of education, and occupational qualifications.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The study found significant variations in vaccination rates: Afghanistan (69.1%), Haiti (11.3%), Malawi (15.4%), Nepal (46.5%), and Senegal (19.6%). Vaccination rates were lower in Haiti due to recent introduction into the national immunization schedule and possibly cost and availability issues. In general, females and those with higher education levels were more likely to be vaccinated. Occupational qualification influenced vaccination rates, often with medical doctors showing higher coverage than nurses.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   The study highlights Afghanistan's robust national hepatitis B immunization strategy, which appears to effectively increase vaccination rates. It suggests that introducing mandatory vaccination for health-related occupations could improve coverage, drawing comparisons with countries like France. However, this may be counterproductive in developing countries with healthcare worker shortages.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors recommend a holistic approach to improving vaccination rates, including making hepatitis B vaccination a prerequisite for healthcare employment, targeting students entering healthcare programs, and ensuring free access to vaccines. They also advocate for increased hepatitis B screening and seeking WHO support where necessary.

7. **Limitations:**
   Key limitations include reliance on limited socioeconomic and demographic variables, lack of causal inference due to the use of population-based surveillance surveys, and variation in data collection periods across countries, which might affect the comparability of the findings. These factors point to the challenges of conducting such studies in politically and economically diverse settings.","Abstract
                Background
                There is a four-fold risk for hepatitis B infection among healthcare workers compared to the general population. Due to limited access to diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B in many resource-constrained settings, there is a real risk that only few healthcare workers with viral hepatitis may get screened or diagnosed and treated. Studies on hepatitis B vaccination among healthcare workers in developing countries are sparse and this bodes ill for intervention and support. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence and explored the associated factors that predicted the uptake of the required, full dosage of hepatitis B vaccination among healthcare workers (HCWs) in five developing countries using nationally representative data.
              
                Methods
                We used recent datasets from the Demographic and Health Surveys Program’s Service Provision Assessment Survey. Descriptive summary statistics and logistic regressions were used to produce the results. Statistical significance was pegged at p &lt; 0.05.
              
                Results
                The proportion of HCWs who received the required doses of hepatitis B vaccine in Afghanistan, Haiti, Malawi, Nepal, and Senegal were 69.1%, 11.3%, 15.4%, 46.5%, and 17.6%, respectively. Gender, occupational qualification, and years of education were significant correlates of receiving the required doses of hepatitis B among HCWs.
              
                Conclusions
                Given the increased risk of hepatitis B infection among healthcare workers, policymakers in developing countries should intensify education campaigns among HCWs and, perhaps, must take it a step further by making hepatitis B vaccination compulsory and a key requirement for employment, especially among those workers who regularly encounter bodily fluids of patients.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most prevalent neurological disorder worldwide, significantly affecting individuals and societies in terms of the disability it causes. The study specifically explores its impact in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, noting the influence of sociopolitical factors like the Iraq-Iran war, economic struggles, and international sanctions, particularly on Iran’s population and mental health.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions**: The study aims to comprehensively analyze the burden of TTH in the MENA region, addressing challenges such as healthcare access disparities and the potential neglect of TTH in health policies and interventions.

3. **Research Methods**: Utilizing global burden of disease (GBD) data, the study calculated age-standardized point prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLD) rates for TTH in 1990 and 2019, comparing regional and global data.

4. **Main Findings**: 
   - There was a 2.0% increase in age-standardized prevalence of TTH in MENA between 1990 and 2019.
   - MENA's TTH burden is higher than the global average, often linked to psychiatric comorbidities like depression and anxiety.
   - Iran has the highest TTH burden in the region, potentially due to sociopolitical factors and increased psychiatric disorders.
   - Women and young to middle-aged adults are particularly affected.
   
5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The study does not directly examine legal frameworks but suggests an urgent need for policy interventions targeting psychiatric comorbidities to reduce TTH-related disabilities.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: 
   - Improved policy interventions focusing on mental health comorbidities are needed.
   - Better awareness, patient education, and healthcare personnel training in managing TTH are critical.
   - More resources should be allocated to research for innovative treatments and preventive strategies against TTH.
   
7. **Limitations**: 
   - Data limitations include restricted data sources and inconsistencies in national health surveys.
   - Lack of inclusion of certain risk factors (e.g., stress, anxiety) in GBD criteria may affect results.
   - Although global data covers demographic diversity, variance across MENA countries like race and ethnicity can lead to differing burden estimates.
   - Difficulty in stratifying data between episodic and chronic TTH limits detailed analysis.

The study underscores the need for more accurate data collection, the evaluation of additional risk factors, and the integration of data between different MENA countries for a more comprehensive understanding of TTH’s impact.","Abstract
                Introduction
                Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most prevalent neurological disorder. As there is a gap in the literature regarding the disease burden attributable to TTH in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the aim of the present study was to report the epidemiological indicators of TTH in MENA, from 1990 to 2019, by sex, age and socio-demographic index (SDI).
              
                Methods
                Publicly available data on the point prevalence, annual incidence and years lived with disability (YLDs) were retrieved from the global burden of disease (GBD) 2019 study for the 21 countries and territories in MENA, between 1990 and 2019. The results were presented with numbers and age-standardised rates per 100000 population, along with their corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).
              
                Results
                In 2019, the age-standardised point prevalence and annual incidence rates for TTH in the MENA region were 24504.5 and 8680.1 per 100000, respectively, which represents a 2.0% and a 0.9% increase over 1990-2019, respectively. The age-standardised YLD rate of TTH in this region in 2019 was estimated to be 68.1 per 100000 population, which has increased 1.0% since 1990. Iran [29640.4] had the highest age-standardised point prevalence rate for TTH, while Turkey [21726.3] had the lowest. In 2019, the regional point prevalence of TTH was highest in the 35-39 and 70-74 age groups, for males and females, respectively. Furthermore, the number of prevalent cases was estimated to be highest in those aged 35-39 and 25-29 years, in both males and females, respectively. Moreover, the burden of TTH was not observed to have a clear association with SDI.
              
                Conclusions
                While the prevalence of TTH in the MENA region increased from 1990 to 2019, the incidence rate did not change. In addition, the burden of TTH in MENA was higher than at the global level for both sexes and all age groups. Therefore, prevention of TTH would help alleviate the attributable burden imposed on the hundreds of millions of people suffering from TTH around the region.

Trends in malaria indicators after scale-up of community-based malaria management in Afghanistan,"Sayed Daoud Mahmoodi, Abdul Alim Atarud, Ahmad Walid Sediqi, Sarah Gallalee, Willi McFarland, Temesgen Birara Aynie, Mohmmad Sami Nahzat, Hamida Hamid, Ghulam Qader Qader, Mohammad Shoaib Tamim, Ali Mirzazadeh",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-022-04174-x,2022-6-3,['United Nations Development Programme'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Disease Prevention', 'Community-Based Healthcare']",,"This article examines the challenges and responses to malaria in Afghanistan, providing insights into the country's public health efforts and the associated human rights concerns.

1. **Historical and Socio-Political Context:** Afghanistan, a country within the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, experiences relatively low malaria transmission, particularly in comparison to some neighboring regions. However, the disease remains a significant public health concern due to its varied incidence rates across different locations, influenced by ecological, socio-economic, and healthcare access factors.

2. **Purpose of the Research:** The research aims to address the persistent public health issue of malaria in Afghanistan and assess the effectiveness of the Community-Based Management of Malaria (CBMM) strategy, particularly after its expansion. This strategy is part of a broader effort to manage health challenges in regions with limited access to diagnostic and treatment facilities, raising questions about equitable healthcare access and the right to health.

3. **Research Methods Summary:** The study evaluates trends in annual malaria incidence and death rates over two periods: before (2012-2015) and after (2016-2019) the CBMM program's expansion. It analyzes national and subnational trends using various indicators to assess the program's impact.

4. **Main Findings:** The analysis reveals that six provinces bordering Pakistan report over 93% of total malaria cases. The CBMM's expansion, particularly through rapid diagnostic testing and community health worker training, has contributed to increased diagnosis, treatment access, and malaria surveillance, although the program's overall effectiveness has not yet been fully evaluated.

5. **Legal and Policy Examination:** Not explicitly discussed in the article, but the research implies a focus on strengthening healthcare policies and community health systems to improve malaria management country-wide.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:** While the CBMM expansion shows promise, the study highlights the need for further evaluation of its effectiveness. Recommendations likely include continuing to enhance diagnostic and treatment capabilities, particularly in high-risk areas, and supporting community health workers and infrastructure.

7. **Study Limitations:** The study's limitation stems from the lack of a formal evaluation of the CBMM program's effectiveness and potential challenges related to Afghanistan's political climate, which could affect data availability and implementation of health strategies. Additionally, sensitivity around human rights issues, such as access to healthcare and equitable treatment, remains an underlying concern.","Abstract
                Background
                The Community-Based Malaria Management (CBMM) strategy, introduced in 2013 and expanded to all health facilities and health posts in Afghanistan by 2016, aimed to deliver rapid diagnostic testing and more timely treatment to all communities nationwide. In this study, trends for several malaria outcome indicators were compared before and after the expansion of the CBMM strategy, using cross-sectional analysis of surveillance data.
              
                Methods
                Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with a Poisson distribution were used to assess trends of three key outcomes before (2012–2015) and after (2016–2019) CBMM expansion. These outcomes were annual malaria incidence rate (both all and confirmed malaria incidence), malaria death rate, and malaria test positivity rate. Additional variables assessed included annual blood examination rates (ABER) and malaria confirmation rate.
              
                Results
                Average malaria incidence rates decreased from 13.1 before CBMM expansion to 10.0 per 1000 persons per year after CBMM expansion (P &lt; 0.001). The time period after CBMM was expanded witnessed a 339% increase in confirmed malaria incidence as compared to the period before (IRR 3.39, 95% CI 2.18, 5.27; P &lt; 0.001). In the period since the expansion of CBMM (2016–2019), overall malaria incidence rate declined by 19% each year (IRR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71,0.92; P = 0.001) and the malaria death rate declined by 85% each year (IRR 0.15, 95% CI 0.12, 0.20; P &lt; 0.001). In comparing the before period to the after period, the ABER increased from 2.3 to 3.5 per 100 person/year, the malaria test positivity rate increased from 12.2 to 20.5%, and the confirmation rate increased from 21% before to 71% after CBMM.
              
                Conclusions
                Afghanistan’s CBMM expansion to introduce rapid diagnostic tests and provide more timely treatment for malaria through all levels of care temporally correlates with significant improvement in multiple indicators of malaria control.

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   Afghanistan is a country with a long history of conflict, making it one of the most fragile and conflict-affected countries globally. The country's economic development is severely lagging, as indicated by a low GDP per capita of $508.9 in 2020. The withdrawal of U.S. troops and the subsequent Taliban takeover have exacerbated the challenges of providing primary care services in Afghanistan.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research aimed to assess the efficiency of primary healthcare facilities under Afghanistan's Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS). It addresses the challenge of delivering effective health services amidst political instability and limited resources by measuring how efficiently these services utilize available inputs to produce health outputs.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study utilized Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to measure the efficiency of three types of health facilities: Comprehensive Health Centers (CHCs), Basic Health Centers (BHCs), and Sub Health Centers (SHCs) across 31 Afghan provinces. Data inputs included health expenditure and personnel numbers, and outputs were measured by the number of services provided. DEA's input-oriented approach focused on identifying potential savings by reducing inputs while maintaining output levels.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The study found variations in efficiency among the different types of health facilities, indicating that not all resources are used optimally. An efficiency score was calculated for each facility, and potential savings were estimated through input-oriented efficiency. The findings suggest room for improvement in resource utilization to achieve cost savings without compromising service delivery.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   The study indirectly references Afghanistan's reliance on NGO-operated facilities for health services. However, it does not provide an in-depth analysis of the country's legal frameworks or policies related to health care and human rights.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that enhancing the efficiency of health facilities can lead to significant savings and more effective primary care service delivery. They recommend a focus on reducing inputs while maintaining the quality of outputs to optimize resource use in health facilities.

7. **Limitations:**
   The study's limitations include potential bias due to data from only 31 out of 34 provinces, which rely on NGOs for health services. The analysis faces challenges inherent to Afghanistan's political climate and the sensitivity of data collection in conflict-affected areas. Data reliability is contingent on the accuracy of EMIS and HMIS, although they are considered established systems.

Overall, the research highlights the critical need for improving efficiency in Afghanistan's healthcare facilities to navigate the complex challenges posed by ongoing conflict and economic constraints.","Abstract
                Background
                Afghanistan’s health system is unique in that primary healthcare is delivered by non-governmental organizations funded by multilateral or bilateral donors, not the government. Given the wide range of implementers providing the basic package of health services, there may be performance differences in service delivery. This study assessed the relative technical efficiency of different levels of primary healthcare services and explored its determinants.
              
                Method
                Data envelopment analysis was used to assess the relative technical efficiency of three levels of primary healthcare facilities (comprehensive, basic, and sub-health centers). The inputs included personnel and capital expenditure, while the outputs were measured by the number of facility visits. Data on inputs and outputs were obtained from national health information databases for 1263 healthcare facilities in 31 provinces. Bivariate analysis was conducted to assess the correlation of various elements with efficiency scores. Regression models were used to identify potential factors associated with efficiency scores at the health facility level.
              
                Results
                The average efficiency score of health facilities was 0.74 when pooling all 1,263 health facilities, with 102 health facilities (8.1%) having efficiency scores of 1 (100% efficient). The lowest quintile of health facilities had an average efficiency score of 0.36, while the highest quintile had a score of 0.96. On average, efficiency scores of comprehensive health centers were higher than basic and sub-health centers by 0.11 and .07, respectively. In addition, the difference between efficiency scores of facilities in the highest and lowest quintiles was highest in facilities that offer fewer services. Thus, they have the largest room for improvement.
              
                Conclusions
                Our findings show that public health facilities in Afghanistan that provide more comprehensive primary health services use their resources more efficiently and that smaller facilities have more room for improvement. A more integrated delivery model would help improve the efficiency of providing primary healthcare in Afghanistan.

"Feasibility of establishing a core set of sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health indicators in humanitarian settings: results from a multi-methods assessment in Bangladesh","Bachera Aktar, Kanya Lakshmi Rajendra, Emily Clark, Kassandre Messier, Anya Aissaoui, Kaeshan Elamurugan, Md. Tanvir Hasan, Nadia Farnaz, Adrita Kaiser, Abdul Awal, Ieman Mona El Mowafi, Loulou Kobeissi",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-022-01424-8,2022-5-21,['BRAC University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Maternal Health', 'Disease Prevention', 'Migration', 'Data Management']",,"Here is a structured summary of the article on the feasibility of collecting proposed core SRMNCAH indicators:

### 1. Historical, Political, or Social Context
The study focuses on the humanitarian context in Bangladesh, particularly in camp-based settings, likely due to the presence of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. Issues of population tracking and health service delivery are complicated by the lack of identification systems and socio-cultural barriers in these settings.

### 2. Purpose of the Research
The research aims to evaluate the feasibility of collecting a core set of Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH) indicators. It addresses challenges such as inadequate resources, infrastructure, and socio-cultural barriers impacting data collection and reporting.

### 3. Research Methods
The study employed stakeholder consultations, including key informant interviews and focus group discussions, to assess the feasibility and relevance of the indicators in Bangladesh. It analyzed various stakeholders' feedback regarding the current systems and resources available for SRMNCAH data collection.

### 4. Main Findings
- **Indicator Feasibility**: 48% were considered relevant and feasible; challenges were marked in tracking newborn (81% feasible), contraception (75%), maternal (53%), and abortion (40%) indicators.
- **Data Collection Gaps**: Many SRMNCAH components lack harmonized reporting systems; fragmented data collection processes lead to duplication and lowered data quality.
- **Legal and Socio-cultural Barriers**: Abortion data collection is hindered by legal status, influencing the feasibility of including abortion indicators unless reframed as menstrual regulation. Stigma affects the collection of HIV/AIDS and SGBV indicators.
  
### 5. Examination of Legal Frameworks
The legal status of abortion in Bangladesh poses challenges, as it endangers data privacy and subjects providers to risks. Government regulations hinder the collection of HIV/AIDS and PMTCT data. Civil registration systems are lacking for forcibly displaced populations.

### 6. Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations
The authors advocate for a harmonized SRMNCAH indicator list to improve data consistency and utility. They suggest aligning indicators with existing systems and recommend addressing infrastructure and resource constraints to enhance data quality. There is a call for policy reforms and investment in national registries for improved demographic data accuracy.

### 7. Limitations of the Study
The study is limited by socio-cultural barriers, legal constraints, and a lack of infrastructure that impairs data collection. Political issues, such as the lack of national policy support in camp-based settings, further complicate comprehensive data collection efforts. The inability to identify patients due to the absence of a national identification or health card exacerbates these challenges.","Abstract
                Background
                Reliable and rigorously collected sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health (SRMNCAH) data in humanitarian settings is often sparse and varies in quality across different humanitarian settings. To address this gap in quality data, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a core set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating SRMNCAH services and outcomes, and assessed their feasibility in Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Jordan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
              
                Methods
                The feasibility assessments aggregated information from global consultations and field-level assessments to reach a consensus on a set of core SRMNCAH indicators among WHO partners. The feasibility assessment in Bangladesh focused on the following constructs: relevance/usefulness of the core set of indicators, the feasibility of measurement, availability of systems and resources, and ethical issues during data collection and management. The field-level multi-methods assessment included five components; a desk review, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and facility assessments including observations of facility-level data management.
              
                Results
                The findings suggest that there is widespread support among stakeholders for developing a standardized core set of SRMNCAH indicators to be collected among all humanitarian actors in Bangladesh. There are numerous resources and data collection systems that could be leveraged, built upon, and improved to ensure the feasibility of collecting this proposed set of indicators. However, the data collection load requested from donors, the national government, international and UN agencies, coordination/cluster systems must be better harmonized, standardized, and less burdensome.
              
                Conclusion
                This core set of indicators would only be useful if it has the buy-in from the international community that results in harmonizing and coordinating data collection efforts and relevant indicators’ reporting requirements.

                Background
                Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are still a major health problem, especially in resource-limited countries. The community-based prevalence of STH is unknown in Afghanistan. Main objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of STH among children in Daman district of Kandahar province in Afghanistan.
              
                Methods
                This was a community-based cross-sectional study, with data collected during five months (June–October, 2020) from children living in five villages of Daman district in Kandahar, Afghanistan. All the stool samples were examined by saline wet mount method. Data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, Chi square test, and multivariate logistic regression.
              
                Results
                A total of 1426 children were studied, with majority (61.8%) of males and the mean age of 6.3 years. The overall prevalence of any intestinal parasitic infection was 39.8%. The overall prevalence of STH infection was 22.7%, with Ascaris lumbricoides (18.7%) as the most prevalent STH species, followed by hookworm (7.5%) and Trichuris trichiura (1.4%). Single, double, and triple STH infections were present in 14.9%, 7.2%, and 0.6% of the children, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that not washing hands after defecating/before eating (AOR 7.0, 95% CI 3.4–14.0), living in mud house (AOR 3.5, 95% CI 1.6–7.4), walking barefoot (AOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.6–3.1), living in overcrowded house (AOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–2.3), and practicing open defecation (AOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1–2.0) as the risk factors associated with the predisposition of rural children for getting STH in Daman district of Afghanistan.
              
                Conclusions
                Prevalence of STH is high among children of Daman district in Afghanistan. Most of the risk factors are related to poverty, decreased sanitation, and improper hygiene. Improvement of socioeconomic status, sanitation, and health education to promote public awareness about health and hygiene together with periodic mass deworming programs are better strategies for the control of STH infections in Afghanistan. Also, government and international donor agencies in Afghanistan should help in improving socio-economic status of the rural areas through provision of basic facilities such as piped water, electricity, good housing, and proper toilets.

                Background
                Afghanistan, a low-income landlocked country, is continuously suffering from domestic war and conflicts; the country struggles to provide quality healthcare services, including affordable medicinal products in the required quantity. Moreover, the quality standards of domestic pharmaceutical companies have not been established yet. One of the internationally recognized guidelines for monitoring manufacturing processes in pharmaceutical companies is Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), recommended by World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether a pharmaceutical company in Kabul, Afghanistan adheres to the GMP standards established by WHO.
              
                Method
                A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the WHO-delineated GMP compliance of 25 pharmaceutical companies in Kabul, Afghanistan. The inspection checklist was developed by Afghanistan's National Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority (NMHRA) using the WHO-delineated GMP guidelines. In addition, direct observation, interviews with respective delegates, and documentation reviews were conducted to collect research data.
              
                Result
                Only 38.33% (1.14 ± 1.08) of GMP contents were complied.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**:
   Afghanistan presents a challenging maternal health environment, impacted by socio-economic disparities affecting healthcare access. Socioeconomic status (SES) factors like wealth and education significantly influence health outcomes, with maternal health services underutilized by women from lower socio-economic backgrounds.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**:
   The research investigates the intersection of antenatal care (ANC) visits with socioeconomic status (SES) factors in predicting maternal healthcare utilization, specifically delivery at health facilities and assistance from skilled birth attendants. It addresses the human rights challenge of equitable access to maternal health services.

3. **Research Methods**:
   The study uses data from a nationally representative survey, applying an intersectionality framework to explore how ANC visits interact with SES indicators such as wealth and education to affect delivery care utilization.

4. **Main Findings**:
   - Women with four or more ANC visits are significantly more likely to deliver at health facilities and be assisted by skilled birth attendants.
   - SES factors like higher education and wealth amplify the likelihood of utilizing institutional maternal care services.
   - The interaction between ANC visits and SES enhances the probability of better maternal health outcomes, highlighting social disparities.
   
5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**:
   The article doesn't explicitly assess Afghanistan's legal frameworks or policies related to human rights. However, it implies the need for policies ensuring equitable maternal healthcare access.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**:
   The authors conclude that ANC visits are crucial for enhancing maternal health service utilization, particularly among higher SES women. They recommend addressing intersectional barriers in maternal healthcare policies and emphasize the importance of educational and economic empowerment for improving healthcare access.

7. **Limitations**:
   Limitations include reliance on self-reported data prone to recall bias, unaddressed confounders such as husbands' SES, and only considering the number (not quality) of ANC visits. Additionally, cultural and institutional barriers that might impact healthcare access are acknowledged but not fully incorporated into the analysis. The political and security climate in Afghanistan also poses challenges for comprehensive research and data collection.","Abstract
                Background
                The importance of antenatal care (ANC) visits in safe motherhood and childbirth is well-documented. However, less is known how social determinants of health interact with ANC visits in shaping the uptake of professional delivery care services in low-income countries. This study examines the associations of ANC visits with institutional delivery care utilization outcomes in Afghanistan. Further, we assess the extent to which ANC visits intersect with education, wealth, and household decision-making autonomy in predicting two outcomes of delivery care utilization- delivery at a health facility and delivery assisted by a skilled birth attendant.
              
                Methods
                We used data from the Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey (AfDHS) 2015. The analytic sample included 15,590 women of reproductive age (15–49). We assessed the associations using logistic regression models, estimated the predicted probability of delivery care outcomes using statistical interactions, and presented estimates in margins plot.
              
                Results
                Multivariable adjusted analyses suggest that women who had 4 or more ANC visits were 5.7 times (95% CI = 4.78, 7.11; P &lt; 0.05) more likely to use delivery care at a health facility and 6.5 times (95% CI = 5.23, 8.03; P &lt; 0.05) more likely to have a delivery assisted by a skilled birth attendant compared to women who had no ANC visit. Estimates from models with statistical interactions of ANC visits with education, wealth, and decision-making autonomy suggest that women with higher social status were more advantageous in utilizing institutional delivery care services compared to women with lower levels of social status.
              
                Conclusion
                Our findings suggest that the associations of ANC visits with institutional delivery care services are stronger among women with higher social status. The results have implications for promoting safe motherhood and childbirth through improving women’s social status.

Intimate partner violence and unmet need for family planning in Afghan women: the implication for policy and practice,"Omid Dadras, Takeo Nakayama, Masahiro Kihara, Masako Ono-Kihara, Fateme Dadras",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-022-01362-5,2022-2-25,['Walailak University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Gender', 'Maternal Health']",,"**Summary**

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:** Afghanistan has endured more than four decades of internal conflict, contributing to a high prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) among married women. Patriarchal social structures and rigid gender norms further exacerbate the situation, resulting in diminished autonomy for women and making IPV a pervasive issue.

2. **Purpose of the Research:** The study aims to provide nationally representative estimates of IPV and unmet need for family planning among Afghan women aged 18–49, while exploring the sociodemographic factors associated with IPV. It specifically examines the relationship between experiencing IPV and unmet family planning needs.

3. **Research Methods:** The study uses a nationally representative sample of married Afghan women aged 18–49 to assess the prevalence of IPV and unmet family planning needs, analyzing trends related to demographics such as age, literacy, poverty, and ethnicity.

4. **Main Findings:** Over half (55.89%) of Afghan women reported experiencing some form of IPV, a decrease from 73% in 2008. IPV was higher among women over 25, those with illiterate partners, and those from the Pashtun, Tajik, and Pashai ethnic groups. Unmet family planning needs were about 30%, especially pronounced in middle-aged women, the poor, and the illiterate. Interestingly, women experiencing IPV often had fewer unmet needs for family planning, possibly as a strategy to avoid pregnancies in abusive settings.

5. **Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies:** The study briefly touches on the patriarchal family structures in Muslim communities, hinting at systemic legal and cultural challenges, but does not delve deeply into specific national legal frameworks. It suggests these norms contribute significantly to the prevalence of IPV and the suppression of women's rights.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:** The authors conclude that IPV remains a significant public health issue affecting reproductive health in Afghanistan. They recommend that policymakers address IPV and sociocultural factors to improve women's reproductive health. They also suggest international bodies develop culturally sensitive interventions to improve women's autonomy and safety.

7. **Study Limitations:** The study recognizes its limitations regarding potential under-reporting of IPV due to cultural norms, sensitivity, and stigma surrounding gender-based violence. Additionally, the complex political climate and scarcity of reliable data in Afghanistan pose challenges for comprehensive research.

The research underscores the pressing need for socio-cultural and policy interventions to tackle the interconnected issues of IPV and reproductive health needs in Afghanistan.","Abstract
                Background
                Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a serious public health issue and has been linked to a range of adverse health outcomes. This study explored the prevalence of IPV and its relationship with the unmet need for family planning among a sample of married Afghan women aged 18–49 years.
              
                Methods
                This study used the data from Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in 2015. The data relating to IPV, unmet need for family planning, and sociodemographic characteristics of Afghan women aged 18–49 (n = 20,593) were extracted and analyzed accounting for the sampling weights and survey design in bivariate and multivariate analyses using the STATA software version 14.
              
                Results
                An estimated 55.89% experienced some type of IPV during the last 12 months. Unmet need for family planning was documented in less than a third of the population. Illiterate employed women from poorer families who were living in the rural areas were more likely to suffer from any type of IPV. Moreover, those from Pashtun, Tajik, and Pashai ethnic groups had a higher odds of any type of violence compared to the reference group (Turkmen). Illiterate women (OR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.02–1.83) with more than 5 pregnancy experiences (OR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.19–1.74) had more unmet needs for family planning compared to the reference group. The unmet needs were almost 40% and 30% less likely to be observed among women from Pashtun and Tajik ethnic backgrounds compared to the reference group (Turkmen), respectively. The likelihood of having unmet needs was 30% less in those women who suffered from any type of violence.
              
                Conclusion
                IPV is an important predictor of several adverse health outcomes. The findings portray the disastrous situation of Afghan women’s rights violation and violence against them and communicate an important message to the international communities and human rights advocate to take immediate actions in order to mitigate the current situation and prevent the violence against Afghan women to improve the integrity of their reproductive health.

"Knowledge, attitudes, practice of people toward the COVID-19 pandemics, and its impact in Afghanistan","Khwaja Mir Islam Saeed, Narges Neyazi, Khushal Nabizada",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.983197,2022-11-17,['Afghanistan National Public Health Institute'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['COVID-19', 'Disease Prevention', 'Financial Inclusion']",,"The article examines a study on the Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP) of the Afghan population regarding COVID-19, alongside the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic. Here is a summary based on the requested points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Afghanistan, marked by a fragile health system and ongoing conflicts, was particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic disrupted social and economic norms globally, exacerbating Afghanistan's socio-economic challenges. The existing insecurity and lack of technical expertise further complicated pandemic management.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions**: The study aimed to assess the Afghan population's knowledge and practices related to COVID-19. It highlighted information gaps crucial for strategic decision-making to address health rights and socio-economic impacts of the pandemic while emphasizing preventive measures and government interventions.

3. **Research Methods**: The cross-sectional study involved a two-stage sampling design covering urban and rural areas across all 34 provinces. Data were collected through face-to-face structured questionnaires from 2,907 participants representing the adult population. Sampling was designed to include both male and female participants and to achieve a balanced representation across different age groups.

4. **Main Findings**: 
   - Knowledge: Over 80% understood COVID-19 preventive measures, and a similar percentage expressed readiness for testing and vaccination.
   - Practices: Only 35% consistently wore masks, although over half adhered to handwashing protocols.
   - Socio-economic Impact: 60% experienced food shortages, and half believed the government successfully enforced lockdowns and raised awareness.
   - Information Sources: Television, social media, and health facilities were primary and trusted information channels.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Institutions**: Although not deeply explored, the study touches on government health policies regarding pandemic management and public communication. Challenges included inadequate treatment services and support for low-income families during the pandemic.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The study concludes that despite high awareness, there was a disconnect between knowledge and action. Recommendations include enhancing communication strategies, especially in rural areas, focusing on educational interventions, involving religious leaders, and supporting vulnerable groups through coordinated efforts among public health authorities and NGOs.

7. **Limitations**: The study's limitations include a focus predominately on urban settings, excluding comprehensive insights from rural areas due to security concerns. Additionally, some potential biases could arise from reliance on self-reported data regarding personal practices and attitudes.","COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the social and economic norms. Knowledge, Attitude and Practices studies are used to address the information gap for further strategic decision making to control the pandemic. This study aimed to find the level of Knowledge, Awareness, Attitudes, and behavioral practices of the people of Afghanistan about the COVID-19 and its impact on health and socio-economic dimension of their routine lives. We used a cross-sectional method with two stage sampling design. Data analysis was performed using SPSS v.20. The survey focused on adults including men and women all over the country to represent the country, including the urban and rural areas. Most of the respondents are in the age group of 21–30 years (46.5%); 60.15% of the participants are married. Almost 75% of females and 84% of males were literate and most participants have a bachelor's degree (34%). More than 80% of participants knew they can prevent themselves from contacting COVID-19 through hand washing frequently with soap and water and wearing a mask. More than 80% of participants responded that they would go for a lab test for detection of the virus as well as COVID-19 vaccination if it is available. Almost 35% reported always wearing a mask to prevent COVID-19 transmission; more than half of participants always wash their hands, more than 60% of them do not touch their eyes, nose, and mouth frequently. Nearly 60% of participants indicated that their household had problems satisfying food needs partly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half of participants believed that the government was successful in applying lockdown measures and in awareness rising (56.8 and 69.8%). The study findings provide some useful insight about the KAP of communities in Afghanistan, which could assist policy makers in public health to design and implement interventions based on the information gaps reported."

Riviere",https://doi.org/10.3138/jmvfh-2021-0125,,['Silver School of Social Work'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available," LAY SUMMARY  Little is known about how military families navigate the challenges they experience during reintegration, the period after a deployment separation when a service member returns home and families must readjust to their presence. This study considers how family risk factors such as the mental health of both partners and protective factors such as social support and participation in military-sponsored training influence family adjustment during reintegration. Military spouses who reported having more social support were likely to report that their families adjusted more quickly during reintegration. However, spouses who expressed concern about a partner’s mental health were less likely to feel prepared for reintegration and, in turn, were more likely to report that their families adjusted more slowly. The results of this study suggest that supporting military spouses in feeling more prepared for reintegration may be an important means to shorten the adjustment period after a deployment. "
"Challenges in antenatal care utilization in Kandahar, Afghanistan: A cross-sectional analytical study","Bilal Ahmad Rahimi, Enayatullah Mohamadi, Muhibullah Maku, Mohammad Dawood Hemat, Khushhal Farooqi, Bashir Ahmad Mahboobi, Ghulam Mohayuddin Mudaser, Walter R. Taylor",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277075,2022-11-21,['Kandahar University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Education']","['Maternal Health', 'Gender']",,"The article examines the barriers to antenatal care (ANC) utilization in Kandahar, Afghanistan, amidst ongoing political instability and poor health infrastructure due to decades of conflict. It addresses the human rights challenges related to maternal health in one of the world’s most dangerous countries for pregnant women, with a significantly high maternal mortality ratio (MMR).

**Research Purpose and Human Rights Challenges:**
The study aims to identify impediments women face in accessing ANC, a crucial service to improve maternal and neonatal health, and to highlight areas for intervention to address these human rights concerns.

**Methods:**
The research involved a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey of 1,524 married women in Kandahar city and Daman district, conducted over a year (Dec 2018-Nov 2019). Statistical analyses were performed to identify key barriers using descriptive statistics, Chi-squared tests, and binary logistic regression.

**Main Findings:**
A significant portion of women did not utilize ANC services, with only 26% attending at least one ANC visit. Key barriers identified included rural residence, illiteracy, lower socioeconomic status, poor behavior of clinic staff, and unplanned pregnancies. Two independent factors that significantly impacted ANC utilization were the poor behavior of clinic personnel and low socioeconomic status.

**Examination of Legal Frameworks/Institutions:**
The study notes that ANC services are available for free in public health facilities, albeit with challenges like unprofessional staff behavior and poor infrastructure, which possibly drive women towards private providers. 

**Conclusions and Recommendations:**
The authors conclude that ANC service utilization in Kandahar is inadequate. They recommend improving the professional behavior of clinic staff, raising women’s educational opportunities, and increasing community awareness about the importance of ANC to enhance service uptake.

**Limitations:**
The study's limitations include potential recall bias and the inability to account for changing risk factors over time or examine the clinical outcomes of pregnancies. Political instability and resource constraints may also affect data comprehensiveness and accuracy.

Overall, the research underscores a critical gap in ANC utilization in Kandahar, exacerbated by systemic socio-economic and institutional barriers, necessitating urgent interventions to uphold maternal health rights.","BackgroundQuality antenatal care (ANC) is one of the four pillars of safe motherhood initiatives and improves the survival and health of mother and neonate. The main objective of this study was to assess the barriers in the utilization of ANC services in Kandahar, Afghanistan.MethodsThis was a cross-sectional analytical study conducted over one year from December 2018–November 2019. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, Chi squared, and binary logistic regression.ResultsA total of 1524 women were recruited in this study with mean age of 30.3 years. Of these women, 848 (55.6%) were rural dwellers, 1450/1510 (96.0%) were illiterate, 438/608 (72.0%) belonged to low-income families, 1112/1508 (73.7%) lived in joint families, 1420/1484 (95.7%) lived in a house of &gt;10 inhabitants, while 388/1494 (26.0%) had attended had at least one ANC visit during their last pregnancy. On univariate analysis, the main barriers in the utilization of ANC services were living in rural areas, being illiterate, having lower socio-economic status, remoteness of the health facility from home, bad behavior of clinic personnel, and unplanned pregnancy. Only lower socio-economic status and bad behavior of clinic personnel were independent explanatory variables in the regression model.ConclusionsUtilization of ANC services is inadequate in Kandahar province. Improving clinic staff professional behavior and status of women by expanding educational opportunities, and enhancing community awareness of the value of ANC are recommended."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Tobacco use is a leading preventable cause of death globally, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where 80% of smokers reside. In South Asia, smoking prevalence is notably high among men, generating significant public health concerns.

2. **Purpose of Research:**
   The study investigates factors associated with cigarette smoking among men aged 15-49 in Afghanistan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan, aiming to provide insights to inform policy and intervention strategies.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study utilizes nationally representative cross-sectional data from the Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 2015 and 2018. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed both pooled and for each country separately, examining socio-demographic factors linked to smoking.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - Cigarette smoking prevalence varying widely, highest in the Maldives (41.2%) and lowest in Pakistan (20.1%).
   - Factors such as age, education, wealth, occupation, and urban residence correlated with smoking, but these differed among countries.
   - Socioeconomic status, age, and education remained key determinants in the pooled analysis.
   - Access to media had mixed effects on smoking behavior.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   The paper does not focus specifically on legal frameworks but calls for comprehensive smoking cessation services and public education.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - Smoking cessation support and public health education targeting high-risk groups are recommended.
   - Strategies should be tailored to country-specific contexts, acknowledging economic and educational disparities.
   - Providing universal access to education is crucial to reducing smoking prevalence.

7. **Study Limitations:**
   The secondary data analysis limitation is mentioned, along with contextual limitations like possible variation in data accuracy due to the political climate and limited primary smoking prevention initiatives. The study underscores the need for more targeted research to establish causal relationships.

Overall, the article highlights the complex socio-demographic determinants of cigarette smoking in South Asia and suggests policy interventions aimed at reducing its prevalence across different population segments.","Smoking is one of the leading causes of premature deaths worldwide. The cigarette is the commonest form of tobacco smoking. This study investigated the factors associated with cigarette smoking among men in five South Asian countries. We analyzed nationally representative cross-sectional study (Demographic and Health Survey) data conducted in Afghanistan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan from 2015–2018. Our study population was men aged between 15 and 49 years. The outcome variable was the prevalence of cigarette smoking. We performed both pooled and country-specific analyses using multivariable logistic regression. The prevalence of cigarette smoking among men is the highest (41.2%) in the Maldives and the lowest (20.1%) in Pakistan. Our pooled analysis found that higher age, lower education, lower wealth status, and involvement in any occupations were strongly associated with cigarette smoking (p-value &lt;0.001). However, we did not find a significant association between age and wealth status in Afghanistan, occupations in Nepal and Pakistan, and education in Pakistan with cigarette smoking when country-specific analyses were performed. In this study, socioeconomic position, age, and urban area are strongly associated with cigarette smoking in South Asian countries. The country-specific circumstances should be considered in planning and designing national smoking control strategies and interventions. However, improving access to smoking cessation services could be an effective intervention for all studied countries, Afghanistan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan."
"Traumatic Brain Injury Classification Variability during the Afghanistan/Iraq Conflicts: Surveillance, Clinical, Research, and Policy Implications","Rachel Sayko Adams, Peter Hoover, Jeri E. Forster, Jesus Caban, Lisa A. Brenner",https://doi.org/10.1097/HTR.0000000000000775,2022-9-5,"['Brandeis University', 'VHA Rocky Mountain Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center']",Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"
            Objective:
            Challenges associated with case ascertainment of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) sustained during the Afghanistan/Iraq military operations have been widespread. This study was designed to examine how the prevalence and severity of TBI among military members who served during the conflicts were impacted when a more precise classification of TBI diagnosis codes was compared with the Department of Defense Standard Surveillance Case-Definition (DoD-Case-Definition).
          
          
            Setting:
            Identification of TBI diagnoses in the Department of Defense's Military Health System from October 7, 2001, until December 31, 2019.
          
          
            Participants:
            Military members with a TBI diagnosis on an encounter record during the study window.
          
          
            Design:
            Descriptive observational study to evaluate the prevalence and severity of TBI with regard to each code set (ie, the DoD-Case-Definition and the more precise set of TBI diagnosis codes). The frequencies of index TBI severity were compared over time and further evaluated against policy changes.
          
          
            Main Measures:
            The more precise TBI diagnosis code set excludes the following: (1) DoD-only extender codes, which are not used in other healthcare settings; and (2) nonprecise TBI codes, which include injuries that do not necessarily meet TBI diagnostic criteria.
          
          
            Results:
            When comparing the 2 TBI classifications, the DoD-Case-Definition captured a higher prevalence of TBIs; 38.5% were classified by the DoD-Case-Definition only (&gt;164 000 military members). 73% of those identified by the DoD-Case-Definition only were diagnosed with nonprecise TBI codes only, with questionable specificity as to whether a TBI occurred.
          
          
            Conclusion:
            We encourage the field to reflect on decisions made pertaining to TBI case ascertainment during the height of the conflicts. Efforts focused on achieving consensus regarding TBI case ascertainment are recommended. Doing so will allow the field to be better prepared for future conflicts, and improve surveillance, screening, and diagnosis in noncombat settings, as well as our ability to understand the long-term effects of TBI.

Factors Associated with Low Birthweight in Low-and-Middle Income Countries in South Asia,"Ngan Ngo, Jahar Bhowmik, Raaj Kishore Biswas",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114139,2022-10-29,['Swinburne University of Technology'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Human Rights']","['Nutrition', 'Maternal Health', 'Gender']",,"Here is a summary of the article you provided:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Low birth weight (LBW) is a significant global public health challenge, especially in low-middle income countries (LMICs) where it leads to high infant mortality rates and long-term health issues. In South Asia (SA), where 28% of the world's LBW children are born, it is crucial to address this issue to meet the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of reducing LBW by 30% by 2025.
 
2. **Purpose of the Research**: The study aims to understand the socio-economic factors associated with LBW across multiple countries in South Asia. This analysis can help policymakers compare and assess effective interventions towards achieving WHO targets on reducing LBW.

3. **Research Methods**: The study used data from population-based cross-sectional demographic and health surveys (DHS) from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan conducted between 2015 and 2021. It analyzed these data using bivariate association and complex-survey generalized linear models to explore factors influencing LBW, considering variables like socio-economic status, maternal education, and media exposure.

4. **Main Findings**: 
   - Pakistan had the highest proportion (18.7%) of LBW, while Nepal had the lowest (11.3%).
   - LBW is more prevalent in households with lower wealth indexes and among mothers without media exposure.
   - Maternal and paternal education levels are inversely related to LBW, with higher education correlating to lower LBW rates.
   - Household decision-making power and rejection of intimate partner violence (IPV) are linked to lower rates of LBW.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The study indirectly highlights gaps in the healthcare systems of these countries, particularly in Pakistan, where cultural norms and inadequate maternal care services contribute to higher LBW rates. Legal and policy frameworks that promote maternal nutrition and healthcare access are essential.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that socio-economic factors, education, and media exposure are crucial in addressing LBW in SA. They recommend focused efforts in Pakistan to improve maternal healthcare and nutrition. They suggest further research, especially around urban-rural disparities and the potential impact of cultural stigmas on accessing medical care.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study’s cross-sectional nature prevents causal inferences. It couldn't include all South Asian LMICs due to data availability and faced inconsistencies as surveys weren't conducted simultaneously. The study also didn't account for maternal comorbidities and parity, which are relevant for comprehensive analysis.

This study provides crucial insights but acknowledges certain limitations, advocating for ongoing research to address these gaps effectively.","Child with Low Birth Weight (LBW) has a higher risk of infant mortality, learning difficulties in childhood due to stunted growth and impaired neurodevelopment, is more likely to develop heart diseases and diabetes in adulthood. This study aimed to evaluate the latest demographic and health surveys (DHSs) across multiple countries in South Asia to determine the factors associated with LBW among these countries. Latest available DHS data across Afghanistan (2015, n = 29,461), Bangladesh (2018, n = 20,127), Nepal (2016, n = 12,862), and Pakistan (2018, n = 15,068) were analysed. Complex survey adjusted generalized linear models were fitted to investigate the association of birth weight with sociodemographic and decision-making factors. Pakistan had the highest proportion of LBW at 18% followed by Afghanistan and Bangladesh at around 14% and Nepal had the lowest (13%). Children born in Pakistan were more likely to have LBW children than Afghanistan (AOR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.49–3.14). Mothers living in rural areas (AOR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.61–0.97), with highly educated partners and belonging to richer families were less susceptible to having child with LBW. To reduce 30% LBW in-line with the World Health Organisation’s 2025 goal, policymakers in SA should focus on women in urban areas with low-educated partners belonging to poor households to ease LBW burden."
"Association between place of delivery, assistance during delivery and fistula occurrence in Afghanistan","Nandeeta Samad, Pranta Das, Bright Opoku Ahinkorah, Abdul-Aziz Seidu, Aliu Mohammed, James Boadu Frimpong, Dipak Kumar Mitra",https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihab074,2021-11-25,"['North South University', ""King's College London""]",Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"Abstract
               
                  Background
                  Obstetric fistula is one of themost serious and devastating childbirth-related injuries women suffer worldwide. This study investigated the association between delivery characteristics and the occurrence of obstetric fistula in Afghanistan.
               
               
                  Methods
                  The study analysed data from the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey. The association between place of delivery and assistance during delivery with experience of fistula symptoms was investigated by fitting two binary logistic regression models.
               
               
                  Results
                  Findings from this study revealed that 23.4% of the women surveyed ever heard about obstetric fistula and 3% reported symptoms of fistula. Women whose deliveries were assisted by traditional birth attendants were significantly more likely to experience fistula compared with those whose deliveries were assisted by doctors. Similarly, women whose deliveries were assisted by others were significantly more likely to experience fistula compared with women whose deliveries were assisted by doctors. Regarding place of delivery, women whose deliveries took place at a government hospital were less likely to experience fistula compared with those whose deliveries took place at home.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  This study highlights the importance of skilled delivery in reducing the risk for obstetric fistula among women in Afghanistan. Therefore, it is important for the various stakeholders in Afghanistan's healthcare delivery system, including healthcare providers, local authorities and international non-governmental organisations, to collaborate and institute measures that will promote health facility deliveries and improve access to skilled delivery.

Understanding context-specific stigma is important in designing mental health interventions. Aim: This study explored the nature and patterns of mental health stigma among community members in Afghanistan. Methods: Using cross-sectional data ( n = 718), descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted. Multivariable linear regression identified determinants of stigma, as reflected by: (1) preference for social distance in relation to depression and psychosis, and (2) intended stigmatising behaviours in relation to mental illness. Results: In descriptive analyses, stigma toward depression and psychosis, especially regarding work and marriage, was found. The label of ‘mental illness’ was especially stigmatising. Most respondents would disclose a mental health problem to family only. Findings of inferential analyses included: stigma was positively associated with higher socioeconomic status, depression and belief in dangerousness; and negatively associated with urban location, female gender, familiarity and belief in a positive prognosis. Conclusions: This study provides new insights on stigma, to inform action in Afghanistan, an under-researched context. Further research and actions must prioritise supportiveness at the family level, especially in remote regions and address cultural issues of the social cost of associating with mental illness. More culturally appropriate, non-stigmatising language surrounding mental illness should be developed. "

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:** The article situates its examination within ongoing global discussions on 'Health for Peace' initiatives, highlighting that gender inequality is a contributor to conflict. It discusses the lack of integration of gender considerations into existing health systems frameworks, especially in war-torn areas like Afghanistan and Syria.

2. **Purpose of Research & Human Rights Questions:** The research aims to address how incorporating a gender lens into health system governance can aid in peacebuilding during active conflicts. It points out the gap between gender equality movements and health systems strengthening in conflict settings, and the potential for gender-inclusive governance to challenge traditional power dynamics and promote human rights.

3. **Research Methods:** The article employs a review of existing literature and case studies to illustrate the intersection of health systems, gender diversity, and peacebuilding efforts in conflict zones like Afghanistan and northwest Syria. 

4. **Main Findings:** The study reveals that gender diverse leadership in health systems could lead to sustainable peace and equitable social recovery post-conflict. In Afghanistan, despite gains in health indicators for women, broader gender equity within the health system remains insufficient. The current political conditions pose risks to female participation in health and education. In northwest Syria, women's contributions to health systems are recognized but largely absent from leadership roles, hindered by a patriarchal social structure.

5. **Legal Frameworks & Policies:** The article discusses Afghanistan's progressive steps (e.g., the establishment of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission and adherence to international gender equality instruments) and highlights the challenges of sustaining these in the current political climate.

6. **Conclusions & Recommendations:** The authors conclude that integrating gender diversity into health systems governance can address inequities and play a role in peacebuilding. They recommend creating a research agenda to gather empirical evidence on this intersection, emphasizing the need for community-led initiatives from the onset.

7. **Limitations of the Study:** Limitations include a lack of empirical evidence and challenges in data collection due to the sensitive nature of conflict settings. Political instability makes it hard to predict the sustainability of gender-inclusive health policies. Additionally, the article highlights criticism of peace-through-health programs that lack tangible outcomes and often have strategic or political motives.","The purpose of this paper is to explore how gender diverse leadership and governance of health systems may contribute to the Health for Peace Agenda. Despite recent momentum, the evidence base to support, implement and evaluate ‘Health for Peace’ programmes remains limited and policy-makers in conflict settings do not consider peace when developing and implementing interventions and health policies. Through this analysis, we found that gender diverse leadership in health systems during active conflict offers greater prospects for sustainable peace and more equitable social economic recovery in the post-conflict period. Therefore, focusing on gender diversity of leadership and governance in health systems strengthening offers a novel way of linking peace and health, particularly in active conflict settings. While components of health systems are beginning to incorporate a gender lens, there remains significant room for improvement particularly in complex and protracted conflicts. Two case studies are explored, north-west Syria and Afghanistan, to highlight that an all-encompassing health systems focus may provide an opportunity for further understanding the link between gender, peace and health in active conflict and advocate for long-term investment in systems impacted by conflict. This approach may enable women and gender minorities to have a voice in the decision-making of health programmes and interventions that supports systems, and enables the community-led and context-specific knowledge and action required to address the root causes of inequalities and inequities in systems and societies."

Poliovirus Immunity among Children Aged 6–11 and 36–48 Months in 14 Polio High-Risk Provinces of Afghanistan: A Health-Facility-Based Study,"Sajid Bashir Soofi, Maureen Martinez, Noha H. Farag, William S. Hendley, Derek Ehrhardt, Imran Ahmed, Imtiaz Hussain, William Weldon, Ahmed M. Kassem",https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10101726,2022-10-16,['The Aga Khan University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Disease Prevention', 'Migration']",,"The article discusses a serological survey conducted in Afghanistan to assess levels of serological protection against poliovirus among children. This research is in response to Afghanistan's continuing struggle with polio, despite global efforts that have significantly reduced poliovirus cases worldwide.

1. **Context**: The study is framed within the ongoing global and national efforts to eradicate polio, particularly emphasizing Afghanistan's role as one of the two remaining countries where polio is still endemic. The article notes that despite efforts and progress since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative’s launch in 1988, political instability and conflict have hindered immunization efforts.

2. **Purpose**: The research aims to evaluate the seroprevalence of antipoliovirus antibodies among children, identify immunity gaps, and assess the effectiveness of Afghanistan’s National Polio Eradication Plan. The study specifically targets challenges such as vaccination bans in certain regions and access issues due to insecurity, which continue to hamper eradication efforts.

3. **Methods**: The researchers conducted a cross-sectional survey in 14 high-risk provinces of Afghanistan, collecting blood samples from children aged 6–11 and 36–48 months visiting selected health facilities. A detailed questionnaire was used to gather demographic information and vaccination history, with samples analyzed for poliovirus neutralizing antibodies at laboratories in Pakistan and the U.S.

4. **Findings**: The study found high seroprevalence rates for poliovirus type 1 (PV1) and type 3 (PV3) but lower rates for type 2 (PV2) among younger children. This was attributed to the cessation of the trivalent OPV and switch to bivalent OPV. Notably, some children in certain provinces were seronegative, suggesting clusters of under-immunized populations that could facilitate virus transmission.

5. **Legal/Policy Framework**: The article references Afghanistan’s National Polio Eradication Action Plan and initiatives like National and Subnational Immunization Days to improve coverage. However, challenges like access restrictions due to armed conflict and population movements (e.g., nomadic groups, refugees) critically affect these efforts.

6. **Conclusions/Recommendations**: The authors conclude that while Afghanistan has made strides in polio immunization, pockets of non-immunized children persist, threatening eradication efforts. They recommend strengthening immunization campaigns to reach inaccessible and nomadic children, and emphasize the need for systematic, routine immunizations, proper documentation, and creating better accessibility in conflict areas.

7. **Limitations**: The study acknowledges that the population surveyed might not represent the entire Afghan population. It notes potential biases since the survey was facility-based, possibly overestimating seroprevalence—children attending health facilities might be more likely to be vaccinated. Further, reliance on caretaker recall for immunization data introduces the risk of recall bias.

Overall, the research underscores the complexities of eradicating polio in a context marked by security and accessibility challenges, calling for adaptive and comprehensive strategies to ensure polio immunization reaches every child.","Afghanistan is one of two countries where wild poliovirus (WPV) type 1 remains endemic. We conducted a facility-based cross-sectional survey of antipoliovirus antibodies in children in 14 provinces of Afghanistan. The provinces were selected based on programmatic priorities for polio eradication. Children aged 6–11 and 36–48 months attending outpatient clinics were enrolled in the study. We collected venous blood, isolated serum, and conducted neutralization assays to detect poliovirus neutralizing antibodies. A total of 2086 children from the 14 provinces were enrolled. Among the enrolled children, 44.3% were girls; the median age in the 6–11-month group was 9.4 months, and in the 36–48-month group, it was 41.8 months. The most common spoken language was Pashtu (70.8%). Eighty-two percent of children were fully immunized against all the diseases in the vaccination schedule of Afghanistan. In the children aged 6–11 months, seroprevalence to poliovirus type 1 (PV1) was 96.5% and seroprevalence to poliovirus type 3 (PV3) was 93%; in children aged 36–48 months, seroprevalence to PV1 was 99.5% and to PV3 was 98%. Antipoliovirus antibody prevalence for poliovirus type 2 (PV2) was 70.5% in the younger group compared with 90.9% in the older children. Children from Herat and Laghman provinces had almost 100% seroprevalence to PV1, and other provinces also had high prevalence, ranging from 92.0% to 99.0%. A similar finding was seen for antibodies against PV3, ranging from 88% to 100% by province. On the contrary, antibodies to PV2 were low, ranging from 53% for children in the Khost province to around 89% in Kunduz. There was a cluster of 18 seronegative children in the Nuristan province. Overall, the polio eradication program of Afghanistan has been successful in achieving high seroprevalence of poliovirus neutralizing antibodies in the parts of the country included in this study."
Bachah-bāzī: A Socio-erotic Tradition,Ali Abdi,https://doi.org/10.3366/afg.2022.0091,,['Yale University'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available," This article looks into the tradition of bachah-bāzī, namely, showing interest for or having liaison with beardless young males, and contextualizes it within Afghan society and culture (and beyond). Complicating some widely held accounts of bachah-bāzī, the article suggests that the “unavailability of females” alone cannot adequately account for the persistence of the tradition in Afghanistan, and that bachahs (beardless young males) are not necessarily “underage boys” but have historically been perceived as distinct gender figures in addition to women and men. More broadly, the article reveals that studying the practice of bachah-bāzī will open up discussions on a range of related subjects, from male friendships and power play among men to gender and family relations and the construction of male desire and (homo)sexuality in Afghanistan. Studying bachah-bāzī may also lead to conversations about the aesthetics of male dance-forms, regional folk songs, music and musical creativity, Sufism and (homoerotic) poetry, histories of war and militarism, and state-building and development and reconstruction projects.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The article discusses the current status of breastfeeding in the EMR, where traditional practices might be influenced by socio-economic factors, health systems, and cultural norms. The region lags behind the global average for exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life, which is crucial for infant health and development.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research aims to investigate breastfeeding and complementary feeding trends in the EMR, exploring the disconnect between these practices and WHO recommendations. It highlights human rights concerns related to children's rights to health and nutrition.

3. **Research Methods**: The study uses regional and global breastfeeding data to compare prevalence rates of exclusive and continued breastfeeding, alongside complementary feeding practices. These statistics are juxtaposed to highlight deficiencies and trends.

4. **Main Findings**: Exclusive breastfeeding in the EMR stands at 30.9%, below global averages and targets set by WHO, with a declining trend in certain countries. Lower adherence to breastfeeding guidelines potentially impacts infant health, leading to increased disease burden. Complementary feeding practices largely align with WHO timing recommendations but still reveal deficiencies.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The study attributes low breastfeeding and complementary feeding rates to factors like poor Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) implementation, lack of support facilities for breastfeeding mothers, and limited health worker training. These institutional gaps need addressing.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: Authors advocate for stronger regional policies and interventions to enhance breastfeeding practices. Emphasis is placed on improving health worker training, hospital initiatives, and providing better support for breastfeeding mothers to align with WHO guidelines.

7. **Limitations**: The study acknowledges challenges related to data collection and socio-political variability across EMR countries. Cultural traditions and socio-economic disparities affect feeding practices, highlighting the need for nuanced, data-driven policy interventions in these regions.","Background: With increasing global rates of overweight, obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) along with undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies, the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) is no exception. This review focuses on specific nutrition parameters among under five years children, namely ever breastfed, exclusive breastfeeding, mixed milk feeding, continued breastfeeding, bottle feeding, introduction of solid, semi-solid, or soft foods and malnutrition. Methodology: PubMed, Google Scholar, United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) databases, World Health Organization (WHO) databases, the World Bank databases and the Global Nutrition Report databases were explored between 10 January and 6 June 2022, to review the nutrition situation among under five years children in the EMR. Results: The regional average prevalence of ever breastfed, exclusive breastfeeding, mixed milk feeding, continued breastfeeding, bottle feeding, introduction of solid, semi-solid, or soft foods was estimated at 84.3%, 30.9%, 42.9%, 41.5%, 32.1% and 69.3%, respectively. Iran, Iraq, Libya and Palestine have seen a decline over time in the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding. Lebanon, Egypt, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia reported early introduction of infant formula. Moreover, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates were seen to introduce food early to the child, at between 4–6 months of age. The estimated weighted regional averages for stunting, wasting and underweight were 20.3%, 8.9% and 13.1%, respectively. Of concern is the increasing prevalence of stunting in Libya. As for overweight and obesity, the average prevalence was reported to be 8.9% and 3%, respectively. Lebanon, Libya, Kuwait and Palestine showed an increased trend throughout this time. Conclusions: In this review, the suboptimal infant and young child feeding patterns and the twofold incidence of malnutrition in the EMR are highlighted and we urge the prioritizing of measures to improve children’s nutrition."

               Climate change has significantly increased the frequency and intensity of human thermal stress, with relatively more severe impacts than those of pure temperature extremes. Despite its major threats to public health, limited studies have assessed spatiotemporal changes in human thermal stress in densely populated regions, like South Asia (SAS). The present study assessed spatiotemporal changes in human thermal stress characteristics in SAS, based on daily minimum, maximum, and mean Universal Thermal Climate Indices (i.e. UTCImin, UTCImax, and UTCImean) using the newly developed high-spatial-resolution database of the thermal-stress Indices over South and East Asia for the period 1981–2019. This study is the first of its kind to assess spatiotemporal changes in UTCI indices over the whole of SAS. The study also carried out extreme events analysis of the UTCI indices and explored their nexus with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index. Results revealed a significant increase in heat stress in SAS, with the highest human thermal stress in western Afghanistan, the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and southeastern, and central parts. The extreme event analysis showed that the study region is likely to observe more frequent and intense heat extremes in the coming decades. The correlation of UTCI indices with ENSO exhibited a robust positive coherence in southeastern and central India, southern Pakistan, and northwestern Afghanistan. The findings of the study are critical in understanding human thermal stress and adopting effective risk reduction strategies against heat extremes in SAS. To better understand the dynamic mechanism of thermal extremes, the study recommends a detailed investigation of the underlying drivers of UTCI variability in SAS."

Wren",https://doi.org/10.1097/SLA.0000000000005592,2022-7-15,"['Joint Base San Antonio', 'U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research']",Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"
            Objective:
            To characterize humanitarian trauma care delivered by US military treatment facilities (MTFs) in Afghanistan and Iraq during combat operations.
          
          
            Background:
            International Humanitarian Law, which includes the Geneva Conventions, defines protections and standards of treatment to victims of armed conflicts. In 1949, these standards expanded to include injured civilians. In 2001, the Global War on Terror began in Afghanistan and expanded to Iraq in 2003. US MTFs provided care to all military forces, civilians, and enemy prisoners. A thorough understanding of the scope, epidemiology, resource requirements, and outcomes of civilian trauma in combat zones has not been previously characterized.
          
          
            Methods:
            Retrospective cohort analysis of the Department of Defense Trauma Registry from 2005 to 2019. Inclusion criteria were civilians and Non–North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Coalition Personnel (NNCP) with traumatic injuries treated at MTFs in Afghanistan and Iraq. Patient demographics, mechanism of injury, resource requirements, procedures, and outcomes were categorized.
          
          
            Results:
            A total of 29,963 casualties were eligible from the Registry. There were 16,749 (55.9%) civilians and 13,214 (44.1%) NNCP. The majority of patients were age above 13 years [26,853 (89.6%)] and male [28,000 (93.4%)]. Most injuries were battle-related: 12,740 (76.1%) civilians and 11,099 (84.0%) NNCP. Penetrating trauma was the most common cause of both battle and nonbattle injuries: 12,293 (73.4%) civilian and 10,029 (75.9%) NNCP. Median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 9 in each cohort with ISS≥25 in 2236 (13.4%) civilians and 1398 (10.6%) NNCP. Blood products were transfused to 35% of each cohort: 5850 civilians received a transfusion with 2118 (12.6%) of them receiving ≥10 units; 4590 NNCPs received a transfusion with 1669 (12.6%) receiving ≥10 units. MTF mortality rates were civilians 1263 (7.5%) and NNCP 776 (5.9%). Interventions, both operative and nonoperative, were similar between both groups.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            In accordance with International Humanitarian Law, as well as the US military’s medical rules of eligibility, civilians injured in combat zones were provided the same level of care as NNCP. Injured civilians and NNCP had similar mechanisms of injury, injury patterns, transfusion needs, and ISS. This analysis demonstrates resource equipoise in trauma care delivered to civilians and NNCP. Hospitals in combat zones must be prepared to manage large numbers of civilian casualties with significant human and material resources allocated to optimize survival. The provision of humanitarian trauma care is resource-intensive, and these data can be used to inform planning factors for current or future humanitarian care in combat zones.

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The study is part of a longitudinal survey on UK military personnel deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan since 2003. The research examines the health and well-being of both deployed and non-deployed personnel in response to the UK's military engagements in these regions.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The research aims to understand the post-deployment health and well-being of UK military personnel, focusing on their mental and physical health challenges. It explores the questions around soldiers' belief in the danger they faced and the length of time spent in hostile environments, which are relevant to human rights concerns related to wartime deployments and the subsequent impact on service members.

3. **Research Methods**: The study employs a questionnaire about sociodemographic details, service information, deployment experiences, and lifestyle. Data was collected from 2014 to 2016 during the third phase of a longitudinal survey. The sample included 8,093 military personnel, focusing on those deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. The research uses a variety of measures and scales, such as the Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory and the Combat Experiences Scale, to assess risk and post-traumatic growth (PTG).

4. **Main Findings**: The study found a correlation between deployment-related experiences (such as combat exposure and the subjective feeling of danger) and post-deployment mental health outcomes, including PTSD. It identifies varying degrees of post-traumatic growth among the personnel, linked to their experiences and sociodemographic factors.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The article does not seem to specifically focus on the examination of legal frameworks, but it indirectly addresses issues within the military and defense related to personnel welfare and mental health.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that deployment experiences significantly impact mental health, suggesting enhanced support and interventions for personnel, especially in managing PTSD and other mental health disorders. They recommend paying attention to sociodemographic factors and the length and nature of exposure to potentially traumatic events.

7. **Limitations**: The study faces limitations related to potential biases in self-reporting, a reduced response rate in the third phase of data collection, and difficulties associated with studying human rights impacts in a military context due to potential sensitivity and confidentiality concerns.

This research provides valuable insights into the effects of hostile deployment on soldiers, with implications for human rights considerations in military contexts.","
	    Background
	    Post-traumatic growth (PTG) refers to beneficial psychological change following trauma.
	  
	  
	    Aims
	    This study explores the sociodemographic, health and deployment-related factors associated with PTG in serving/ex-serving UK armed forces personnel deployed to military operations in Iraq or Afghanistan.
	  
	  
	    Method
	    Multinomial logistic regression analyses were applied to retrospective questionnaire data collected 2014–2016, stratified by gender. PTG scores were split into tertiles of no/very low PTG, low PTG and moderate/large PTG.
	  
	  
	    Results
	    A total of 1447/4610 male personnel (30.8%) and 198/570 female personnel (34.8%) reported moderate/large PTG. Male personnel were more likely to report moderate/large PTG compared with no/very low PTG if they reported a greater belief of being in serious danger (relative risk ratio (RRR) 2.47, 95% CI 1.68–3.64), were a reservist (RRR 2.37, 95% CI 1.80–3.11), reported good/excellent general health (fair/poor general health: RRR 0.33, 95% CI 0.24–0.46), a greater number of combat experiences, less alcohol use, better mental health, were of lower rank or were younger. Female personnel were more likely to report moderate/large PTG if they were single (in a relationship: RRR 0.40, 95% CI 0.22–0.74), had left military service (RRR 2.34, 95% CI 1.31–4.17), reported better mental health (common mental disorder: RRR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17–0.84), were a reservist, reported a greater number of combat experiences or were younger. Post-traumatic stress disorder had a curvilinear relationship with PTG.
	  
	  
	    Conclusions
	    A moderate/large degree of PTG among the UK armed forces is associated with mostly positive health experiences, except for post-traumatic stress disorder.

Here is a summary following your outlined points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:** 
   The Taliban's re-emergence in Afghanistan follows two decades of foreign intervention which failed to stabilize the country completely. The Taliban's victory represents a significant shift in the region, impacting global jihadism, potential ethnic conflicts, and changing dynamics between major international stakeholders like the U.S., China, and Russia.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Concerns:**
   The article assesses the potential increase in terrorist threats from Afghanistan and highlights the challenge of preserving peace and human rights under the Taliban's rule. Concerns focus on whether the Taliban can fulfill international commitments to curb terrorism and ensure stability without repeating past human rights abuses.

3. **Research Methods:** 
   The piece relies on historical analysis, geopolitical assessments, and expert opinions on the implications of Afghanistan’s political changes. It considers statements from international policymakers and regional observers.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The Taliban's victory raises concerns over increased terrorist threats, not only from within Afghanistan but also their potential influence across Central Asia. There are fears of factional divisions within the Taliban escalating into power struggles. The return of Taliban rule also inspires regional insurgent groups, as seen with the TTP in Pakistan.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   The article discusses the Taliban's commitments to international agreements, like the February 2020 deal with the U.S., regarding anti-terrorism measures, and speculates on their compliance. It also explores how neighboring countries might navigate relationships with the Taliban concerning security interests.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The piece warns that the Taliban's initial stability might be misleading and raises concerns about uncontrolled terrorist activities. Countries like Russia, China, and Iran adopt a pragmatic approach toward engaging with the Taliban, focusing on stability and strategic interests. Recommendations emphasize cautious monitoring of developments and potential diplomatic engagements conditioned on the Taliban’s governance behavior.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   Data on the Taliban’s current governance efficacy is limited. The study's insights rely on historical analogies and expert opinions rather than on-the-ground evidence, which is constrained by Afghanistan's volatile political climate and data scarcity. It also acknowledges the sensitivity surrounding human rights and security issues.

Overall, the article outlines a cautious but strategic international response regarding Afghanistan’s future under Taliban rule, with key global players adjusting their diplomatic, security, and economic strategies accordingly.","
                Abstract
                The studies that have generated the present article have been sparked by a timely question: how does the waning of Western military presence in Afghanistan impact the wider region around this country? The implications of this process go far beyond the immediate effects of the reduction of forces by the U.S. and its allies in the coalition led by NATO. The states in close geographic proximity to Afghanistan, as well as other external powers, notably Russia, have interests in how the transformation of the regional security environment occurs. This article provides background information for understanding the Biden administration’s decision to complete the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, assesses the reaction of neighboring countries to the rise of the Taliban, and examines the political and military consequences of regime change in Afghanistan and their impact on regional security. Some additional lines of research are considered as needed.

Mental health impacts of earthquake on Afghans amidst humanitarian crisis,"Sayed Jawad Hussaini, Syed Hasham Ali, Zainab Syyeda Rahmat, Zarmina Islam, Zoaib Habib Tharwani",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2022.104521,,['Dow Medical College Pakistan'],Letter,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Mental Health', 'Disaster Risk Reduction']",,"The article discusses the mental health crisis in Afghanistan, emphasizing the impact of the recent 5.9 magnitude earthquake on an already burdened population due to decades of civil conflict and economic instability. Historically, Afghanistan has struggled with a high prevalence of mental disorders, exacerbated by natural disasters and the socio-political challenges post-Taliban takeover which halted foreign funding crucial for mental health services.

The research aims to investigate the mental health challenges following the earthquake and proposes recommendations to tackle these issues. Specific human rights concerns include the stigmatization of mental health, the lack of accessible care, and the heightened vulnerability of rural populations.

To gather data, the study reviewed available literature on mental health conditions in Afghanistan, focusing on the additional strain caused by the earthquake in regions like Paktika and Khost. The scope also included a survey reflecting on the mental health status in eight Afghan provinces.

Main findings reveal a heightened incidence of mental health disorders such as PTSD and depression linked to the earthquake, driven by physical trauma, loss, and displacement. The lack of mental health resources and difficult terrain exacerbate these issues, leading to increased substance abuse, societal dysfunction, and violence.

Examining Afghanistan's mental health framework, the authors note the absence of infrastructure and policies addressing mental health sufficiently, compounded by socio-economic conditions where almost all in Paktika live in poverty.

The authors recommend international investment in training Afghan health workers, integrating religion with mental health care to reduce stigma, and using technology like telemedicine for remote support. They suggest engaging local leaders to endorse mental health initiatives, balancing gender representation among mental health professionals, and creating work-and-play camps for rehabilitation.

Limitations include political instability impacting data reliability, sensitivity around mental health discussions, and geographical obstacles that restrict timely intervention.

The study concludes that more proactive international efforts are vital to sustain mental health services in Afghanistan and mitigate the impacts of natural and socio-political disasters. Raising awareness and reducing stigma are critical steps to improve mental health outcomes.",No abstract available

We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), focusing on women aged 20–24 years old based on the United Nations’ recommendation on child marriage study. Multivariate logistic models examined the association between child marriage, reproductive outcomes, and service utilization. An estimated 52% of the Afghan women aged 20–24 married at ages less than 18 years. Poverty and illiteracy were associated with the higher likelihood of early marriage. There was a significant negative relationship between child marriage and history of rapid repeat childbirth, delivery by skilled personnel, and institutional delivery. In both adjusted and unadjusted models, women married at age ≤14 were more likely to experience terminated or unintended pregnancy, inadequate ANC, unmet need for family planning, and fistula; while, for those married at age 15–17 years, only terminated or unintended pregnancy remained significant. Strict international law enforcement and advocacy are needed in the current situation of Afghanistan to increase young women's education, promote their civil rights, and improve their autonomy and role in decision‐making concerning their fertility preferences and reproductive health."

1. **Context**: Historically, when the Taliban first governed Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, they imposed severe restrictions on women's and girls' rights, closing girls' schools and barring women from work. With the Taliban's return to power in August 2021, there were significant fears of a similar regression. However, the socio-political landscape has evolved, with a generation now well-versed in technology and connected globally, resisting a return to the past.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The research highlights the human rights challenges posed by the Taliban's policies, especially their effects on education and employment for women and girls. It questions the efficacy of the international community's response, particularly whether isolating the Taliban is helping or hindering efforts to improve the situation.

3. **Methods**: This piece appears to be a qualitative analysis based on recent developments, examining the policies implemented by the Taliban and responses by other nations through international engagements, funding decisions, and informal educational initiatives within Afghanistan.

4. **Main Findings**: The study finds severe restrictions on women's participation in the workplace and education, with secondary education for girls largely banned and many women demoted or excluded from leadership roles. Some countries continue educational collaborations, but many Western nations have stopped funding educational and research initiatives in protest.

5. **Legal and Policy Examination**: While the article suggests a division within the Taliban regarding policies on women's rights, it does not delve deeply into Afghanistan's legal systems but notes the international community's withdrawal of governmental support as a pressure tactic.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors urge a reevaluation of global strategies, suggesting enhanced support for initiatives like online education that promote broad access to knowledge. They recommend engaging positively with the current leadership to foster inclusive development, rather than complete international isolation.

7. **Limitations**: The study notes the complex political climate in Afghanistan, making systematic assessment challenging. It highlights the risk of isolation backfiring, potentially cutting off moderate Taliban factions from external influences that could advocate for change. The sensitivity of human rights discourse under an authoritarian regime also constrains transparent analysis.",No abstract available

This prolonged state of crisis has detrimentally impacted Afghan society, particularly affecting children who lack access to basic human necessities and freedom.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research aims to highlight the human rights challenges and violations faced by Afghan children, particularly focusing on their mental health. It addresses the pressing issue of unmet mental health needs and the associated psychological impact due to the chronic stress and instability in the region.

3. **Research Methods**: While the specific research methods are not detailed in the summary, the study appears to be based on a review of existing literature and data on the mental health crisis and socioeconomic conditions affecting Afghan children.

4. **Main Findings**: The study finds that Afghan children are suffering from severe mental health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression. These conditions are exacerbated by the lack of basic needs and freedom, leading to isolation and a lack of voice.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The summary does not specifically mention an examination of Afghanistan's legal frameworks or policies relating to human rights.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that an urgent action plan is necessary to address the mental health crisis among Afghan children. They recommend mental health services, psychological training, awareness campaigns, and initiatives to support the reintegration of Afghan refugees and children reconnecting with loved ones.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The summary does not specify limitations; however, potential limitations could include the availability of reliable data due to the political climate in Afghanistan, the sensitivity of conducting research in a conflict zone, and the challenge of accessing representative samples of the affected population.","AbstractAfghan children have suffered for decades because of chronic socioeconomic health crises.

1. **Historical and Social Context**: Afghanistan has been severely affected by decades of conflict, which has disorganized its healthcare systems, disproportionately affecting mental health services. This backdrop provides context for current efforts to improve mental health care, as the country has few specialized resources and trained mental health professionals, exacerbating the issue.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The research aims to investigate the accessibility and equity of mental healthcare services across Afghanistan, a crucial human rights issue in a country grappling with significant mental health burdens and limited resources. The study addresses the challenge of delivering equitable mental health services in conflict-affected regions.

3. **Research Methods**: The study used a national household survey conducted across eight Afghan regions using a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling method. Data were gathered through interviews with 4,445 participants, assessing mental health using several diagnostic tools and socioeconomic factors to investigate service accessibility.

4. **Main Findings**: The study found that 50.46% of respondents reported some form of mental health problem, while only 10.74% had sought help at any point. There were significant regional disparities in accessing care, with higher needs not being met in more dangerous areas. Help-seeking behavior was influenced by the severity of mental health issues rather than sociodemographic factors like gender or income.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies**: Afghanistan has attempted to integrate mental health into its healthcare system through the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS), which provides tiered healthcare access. The research highlights the developed referral system and structured training for healthcare workers in mental health.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that while mental healthcare accessibility in Afghanistan is comparable to other middle and some high-middle-income countries, significant regional disparities remain. They recommend prioritizing service implementation in highly dangerous areas and continuing to build infrastructure despite political challenges. Monitoring access to care as the political situation evolves is also emphasized.

7. **Study Limitations**: Limitations include potential sampling bias due to security issues, imprecise danger level categorization, language translation challenges, and reliance on self-reported data.

"The ""trauma pitch"": How stigma emerges for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans seeking disability compensation",Katinka Hooyer,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267424,2022-8-31,['Medical College of Wisconsin'],Article,1,Yes,"['Security and Conflict', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Veterans', 'Disease Prevention']",,"1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: After two decades of conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, many veterans suffer from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which is heavily stigmatized. This stigma significantly impacts veterans’ willingness to seek treatment. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is supposed to support veterans with financial aid and healthcare, but the process of obtaining service-connected disability status may intensify feelings of stigma.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The study aims to explore how the process of acquiring service-connected disability benefits can exacerbate stigma for veterans with PTSD. It addresses the human rights challenge of ensuring adequate support for veterans without compounding their mental health struggles through stigmatization.

3. **Research Methods**: This ethnographic study involves narratives from veterans to identify experiences of stigma within the Veterans Affairs (VA) disability claims process. It situates observations at both structural and individual levels within the VA system.

4. **Main Findings**: The study found two main areas of stigma: the structural stigma during the bureaucratic disability claims process and individual-level stigma in interactions with VA service providers. The claims process, which requires repeated recounting of personal trauma, coupled with institutional stigma regarding malingering, leads to bureaugenic effects, worsening veterans' PTSD symptoms. This discourages some veterans from seeking treatment initially, although it doesn't seem to affect those already receiving treatment. Despite the stigma, veterans pursue disability compensation as it offers validation of their suffering and sacrifice.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The study delves into the VA's disability claims process, highlighting the bureaucratic challenges veterans face. It emphasizes the need for proving ""service connection"" and describes the VA's disability rating system, which affects veterans' healthcare access and compensation.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors suggest that the bureaucratic process for PTSD claims not only deters treatment but also exacerbates symptoms. They recommend minimizing repetitive trauma recounting and addressing institutional perceptions of malingering to reduce stigma, thus improving the claims process.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study's limitations include reliance on narrative data, which may not capture the full scope of experiences due to ethical constraints on data sharing. Additionally, the sensitive nature of PTSD and stigma in the military context may limit candor among participants, potentially affecting the findings.","Posttraumatic Stress Disorder continues to be a highly stigmatized disease for the veteran population and stigma, experienced as a mark of discredit or shame, continues to be identified as the main deterrent in treatment seeking. Little attention has been paid to how the process of obtaining service-connected disability status can amplify veterans’ perceptions of being stigmatized. The following ethnographic study identified how combat veterans experienced stigma in processing through Veterans Affairs care and the effects of linking a Posttraumatic Stress Disorder diagnosis with disability compensation. Stigma was identified in two inter-related areas: 1) the structural level in the Veterans Affairs disability claims process and 2) the individual level in interactions with Veterans Affairs service providers. Findings based on veterans’ narratives suggest that the disability claims process, requiring multiple repetitions of personal trauma, coupled with perceptions of institutional stigmas of malingering, created bureaugenic effects: a worsening of symptoms caused by bureaucratic protocols intended to help veterans. This process influenced first time treatment users of the Veterans Affairs by deterring treatment-seeking behavior but was not found to affect veterans who had already initiated treatment. Despite the experience of stigma and commodification of their suffering through disability and diagnostic screening, veterans still sought disability compensation. Veterans viewed this compensation as acknowledgment of their loss and validation of their sacrifice."

Spousal Violence and Contraceptive Use among Married Afghan Women in a Nationally Representative Sample,"Sahra Ibrahimi, Julia R. Steinberg",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169783,2022-8-9,['University of Maryland School of Public Health'],Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Gender', 'Maternal Health']",,"### Summary of the Article:

**1. Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
Afghanistan has a long history of conflict, dating back to continuous war since 1973, which has entrenched structural violence deeply affecting societal norms. Under the Taliban's previous and current rule, women's rights have significantly regressed, with limitations on education, employment, and autonomy, contributing to a patriarchal culture where violence against women is prevalent. Historically, Afghanistan has seen hegemonic masculinity sustain male dominance, exacerbating intimate partner violence (IPV).

**2. Purpose and Human Rights Challenges:**
This research investigates the connection between IPV and contraceptive use among Afghan women. It scrutinizes whether spousal violence influences the likelihood of using contraceptives, especially methods controlled by women, amidst high rates of spousal violence (56%) and low contraceptive use (23%). The study seeks to address these issues amidst increasing gender-based violence under the Taliban regime.

**3. Research Methods:**
The study utilized data from the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey (AfDHS), employing a cross-sectional national survey covering all 34 provinces of Afghanistan. Using a stratified two-phase sampling design, it involved interviews with women aged 15-49 to assess contraceptive use and experience of IPV, adhering to WHO guidelines for ethical data collection. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore associations between types of spousal violence and contraceptive usage.

**4. Main Findings:**
The study found significant associations between the experience of spousal violence and contraceptive use, with findings indicating that women experiencing multiple types of violence were more likely to use female-controlled contraceptives. These findings suggest IPV's impact on women's reproductive autonomy and the need for increased attention to IPV as a factor in family planning.

**5. Legal Frameworks and Institutions:**
The study highlights Afghanistan's ratification of the Elimination of Violence Against Women Law (EVAWL) and its limited efficacy, with a preference for prosecuting domestic violence through Penal Code or Sharia law, often leading to inadequate legal protection for women. The dismantling of the Ministry of Women’s Affairs under the Taliban has further weakened legal protections for women’s rights.

**6. Conclusions and Recommendations:**
The authors conclude that IPV significantly influences contraceptive behavior among Afghan women, advocating for policies enhancing women's autonomy and protection from IPV. They recommend strengthening legal frameworks, ensuring women's access to family planning, and culturally sensitive interventions to mitigate the effects of IPV on reproductive health.

**7. Limitations:**
The study acknowledges limitations regarding data availability and potential biases due to Afghanistan's current political climate under the Taliban, impacting data collection reliability and women's willingness to report IPV. Privacy and security concerns also restricted interviews, thus potentially affecting the comprehensiveness of the dataset.","Objective: Afghanistan is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of spousal violence (56%) and a low prevalence of contraceptive use (23%), yet there is no study assessing how spousal violence is related to contraceptive use, and what methods are most used by women. Therefore, this study examined the association between the number of types of spousal violence and contraceptive use. Method: Using data from 18,985 Afghan married women, aged 15 to 49, who responded to the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey, the current contraceptive method was grouped into five categories: male-involved methods, pills, injectables, long-acting reversible contraception, female sterilization, and Lactation Amenorrhea Method. The number of types of spousal violence in the past 12 months was categorized as none, one type, or two or more types, based on women’s experiences with verbal, physical, and sexual violence. For analysis, binary and multinomial logistic regression were used. Results: After adjusting for the covariates, the experience of any spousal violence was associated with contraception use (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.64–2.27, p = 0.0001). Among those using contraception, experiencing two or three types of spousal violence was associated with using pills (adjusted risk ratio (aRRR) = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.63–2.77, p = 0.0001), injections (aRRR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.26–2.41, p = 0.001), and LAM (aRRR = 3.27, 95% CI: 2.05–5.20, p = 0.0001), compared to male-involved methods. Conclusions: The findings of this study may inform policymakers and program implementers in designing interventions to address the pervasive problem of violence against women, and make pills and injectables more accessible to Afghan women, since these methods are under women’s control and more often used in Afghanistan."

"Association between triage level and outcomes at Médecins Sans Frontières trauma hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, 2015","Hadjer Latif Daebes, Linnea Latifa Tounsi, Maximilian Nerlander, Martin Gerdin Wärnberg, Momer Jaweed, Bashir Ahmad Mamozai, Masood Nasim, Miguel Trelles, Johan von Schreeb",https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-209470,2021-11-10,['Karolinska Institutet'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Disease Prevention', 'Disaster Risk Reduction', 'Trauma Care in Conflict Settings']",,"The article examines the effectiveness of the South African Triage Scale (SATS) used at the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Kunduz Trauma Centre (KTC) in Afghanistan, a low-resource conflict setting. The study aimed to assess how well SATS triage levels predicted patient outcomes, such as hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality, amidst the region's continuous conflict and violence.

**1. Context:**  
Afghanistan, especially the Kunduz province, has been grappling with conflict for over 35 years, severely affecting healthcare access and outcomes. The KTC provided critical trauma care from 2011 until it was destroyed by a U.S. airstrike in 2015.

**2. Purpose:**  
The research focused on assessing the correlation between SATS triage levels and patient outcomes at KTC, addressing the challenge of optimizing trauma care in conflict zones.

**3. Methods:**  
The study analyzed data from 17,970 patients treated at the KTC in 2015 using logistic regression to examine the relationship between triage levels and outcomes. Variables considered included age, sex, and delays in arrival.

**4. Findings:**  
The SATS demonstrated high sensitivity in predicting outcomes, such as increased risk of ICU admission and mortality for patients triaged as red and orange. The study noted a low mortality rate at KTC compared to trauma centers in high-income settings, suggesting critical patients frequently did not survive until reaching the center. Delayed arrival also correlated with poorer outcomes.

**5. Examination of Legal Frameworks:**  
While the study doesn’t deeply focus on legal frameworks, it notes the healthcare challenges in conflict-driven Afghanistan, highlighting the need for prehospital care improvements.

**6. Conclusions and Recommendations:**  
The study underscores the importance of prehospital care and rapid transport to enhance trauma survivability. Recommendations include implementing targeted public health interventions to strengthen emergency care.

**7. Limitations:**  
Key limitations include the political climate and the destruction of medical records after the airstrike, impacting follow-up. The broad inclusion criteria, though necessary for a representative sample, also affected result significance. The study was retrospective, limiting patient consent and follow-up analysis. Data on long-term disability post-triage was unavailable but could provide additional insights into the triage system’s impact.","BackgroundFive million people die annually due to injuries; an increasing part is due to armed conflict in low-income and middle-income countries, demanding resolute emergency trauma care. In Afghanistan, a low-income country that has experienced conflict for over 35 years, conflict related trauma is a significant public health problem. To address this, the non-governmental organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) set up a trauma centre in Kunduz (Kunduz Trauma Centre (KTC)). MSF’s standardised emergency operating procedures include the South African Triage Scale (SATS). To date, there are few studies that assess how triage levels correspond with outcome in low-resource conflict settingsAimThis study aims to assess to what extent SATS triage levels correlated to outcomes in terms of hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality for patients treated at KTC.Method and materialsThis retrospective study used routinely collected data from KTC registries. A total of 17 970 patients were included. The outcomes were hospital admission, ICU admission and mortality. The explanatory variable was triage level. Covariates including age, gender and delay to arrival were used. Logistic regression was used to study the correlation between triage level and outcomes.ResultsOut of all patients seeking care, 28.7% were triaged as red or orange. The overall mortality was 0.6%. In total, 90% of those that died and 79% of ICU-admitted patients were triaged as red.ConclusionThe risk of positive and negative outcomes correlated with triage level. None of the patients triaged as green died or were admitted to the ICU whereas 90% of patients who died were triaged as red."

The study responds to the limited testing and surveillance capacity in Afghanistan, which likely led to the underreporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths. The primary purposes of the research were to assess the COVID-19 infection rates in the general population, including age-specific cumulative incidence and the prevalence of asymptomatic or subclinical infections.

**Context:**
The COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges worldwide, and Afghanistan, with its disrupted health system and political instability, was particularly vulnerable. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were initially enforced but waned as political transitions occurred, affecting the country's ability to manage the pandemic effectively.

**Research Methods:**
The study involved serological testing using Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) for antibodies (IgM and IgG) against SARS-CoV-2, alongside a comprehensive questionnaire survey. A two-stage cluster sampling design was used to ensure representative samples from nine regions of Afghanistan. Adjustments were made for test sensitivity and specificity as well as antibody decay.

**Main Findings:**
- Approximately 31.5% of Afghanistan's population was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, indicative of past or current infection. Urban areas showed higher seroprevalence rates than rural areas.
- Kabul region had the highest seroprevalence.
- The findings indicated a substantial underreporting of COVID-19 cases relative to the official figures, identifying a significant gap in testing and case detection.

**Legal Framework and Policies:**
The article examines the impact of political instability on public health measures. The disruption of public health systems and the lifting of NPIs despite low vaccination rates and widespread vulnerability to infection present challenges.

**Conclusions and Recommendations:**
The study concludes that Afghanistan remains at risk of further COVID-19 spread due to low vaccination rates and insufficient natural immunity in the population. It emphasizes that NPIs should not be lifted hastily and stresses the need for sustained public health measures. It also highlights the requirement for a robust healthcare infrastructure to handle potential future surges, particularly with emerging variants.

**Limitations:**
The study faced limitations, including security concerns that restricted access to certain areas and a limited timeframe to conduct the survey. Data entry challenges also posed difficulties in maintaining data quality. Furthermore, the estimates may not fully account for new variants like Delta and Omicron, which emerged after the study was conducted.

Overall, the article underscores the urgency for continued vigilance and strengthened health responses in Afghanistan to combat COVID-19 amid ongoing sociopolitical challenges.","ObjectiveThe primary objectives were to determine the magnitude of COVID-19 infections in the general population and age-specific cumulative incidence, as determined by seropositivity and clinical symptoms of COVID-19, and to determine the magnitude of asymptomatic or subclinical infections.Design, setting and participantsWe describe a population-based, cross-sectional, age-stratified seroepidemiological study conducted throughout Afghanistan during June/July 2020. Participants were interviewed to complete a questionnaire, and rapid diagnostic tests were used to test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This national study was conducted in eight regions of Afghanistan plus Kabul province, considered a separate region. The total sample size was 9514, and the number of participants required in each region was estimated proportionally to the population size of each region. For each region, 31–44 enumeration areas (EAs) were randomly selected, and a total of 360 clusters and 16 households per EA were selected using random sampling. To adjust the seroprevalence for test sensitivity and specificity, and seroreversion, Bernoulli’s model methodology was used to infer the population exposure in Afghanistan.Outcome measuresThe main outcome was to determine the prevalence of current or past COVID-19 infection.ResultsThe survey revealed that, to July 2020, around 10 million people in Afghanistan (31.5% of the population) had either current or previous COVID-19 infection. By age group, COVID-19 seroprevalence was reported to be 35.1% and 25.3% among participants aged ≥18 and 5–17 years, respectively. This implies that most of the population remained at risk of infection. However, a large proportion of the population had been infected in some localities, for example, Kabul province, where more than half of the population had been infected with COVID-19.ConclusionAs most of the population remained at risk of infection at the time of the study, any lifting of public health and social measures needed to be considered gradually."
Missed opportunities for vaccination (MOV) in children up to 5 years old in 19 Médecins Sans Frontières-supported health facilities: A cross-sectional survey in six low-resource countries,"Blanca Borras-Bermejo, Isabella Panunzi, Catherine Bachy, Julita Gil-Cuesta",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059900,2022-7-26,"[""Vall d'Hebron Institut de Recerca""]",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Disease Prevention', 'Immunization Access']",,"**Summary of the Article:**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:** 
   - Since 1983, the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) has aimed to use every healthcare visit to vaccinate eligible children. Despite efforts, missed opportunities for vaccination (MOV) have remained a significant issue, particularly in low and middle-income countries where 44% of undervaccination cases are linked to healthcare system failures or access issues. Previous studies have shown high prevalences of MOV, which remain substantial today.

2. **Purpose of Research and Human Rights Questions:**
   - The research aims to systematically assess MOV among children up to 5 years old within MSF programs in six countries. This addresses human rights challenges related to ensuring children's right to health and access to essential vaccinations.

3. **Research Methods:**
   - The study involved cross-sectional exit surveys conducted from 2011 to 2015 in 19 health facilities across six countries, interviewing caregivers of children up to 5 years old. Data were collected about vaccination status and the reasons for uncompleted vaccinations during healthcare visits.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - MOV prevalence was found to be 64% in the surveyed population, higher than past estimates. Older children, those visiting for non-vaccination reasons, and children visiting hospitals had higher MOV rates. The study identified a critical gap in vaccinating older children and children visiting for other health services.

5. **Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies:**
   - The study does not directly examine legal frameworks but highlights inadequacies in national immunization programs that restrict vaccination opportunities for older children, suggesting a need for policy reform to include a broader age range.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - The authors conclude that MOV is underestimated, particularly for children beyond the traditional EPI age group. They recommend national immunization programs adopt a ""never too old"" approach and integrate vaccination into other healthcare services. There is also a call for improved training of healthcare workers and adequate vaccine supply.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   - The study is limited by its non-representative sample, lack of exploration of healthcare providers' practices, and exclusion of children without vaccination cards, possibly underestimating MOV. Additionally, gender information was not collected, missing potential insights into gender-related differences in vaccination rates.

Overall, the study highlights significant MOV in low-resource settings, advocating for policy changes and enhanced healthcare practices to ensure all children have access to vaccinations, which is a fundamental human right.","ObjectiveTo describe missed opportunities for vaccination (MOV) among children visiting Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)-supported facilities, their related factors, and to identify reasons for non-vaccination.DesignCross-sectional surveys conducted between 2011 and 2015.Setting and participantsChildren up to 59 months of age visiting 19 MSF-supported facilities (15 primary healthcare centres and four hospitals) in Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mauritania, Niger, Pakistan and South Sudan. Only children whose caregivers presented their vaccination card were included.Outcome measuresWe describe MOV prevalence and reasons for no vaccination. We also assess the association of MOV with age, type of facility and reason for visit.ResultsAmong 5055 children’s caregivers interviewed, 2738 presented a vaccination card of whom 62.8% were eligible for vaccination, and of those, 64.6% had an MOV. Presence of MOV was more likely in children visiting a hospital or a health facility for a reason other than vaccination. MOV occurrence was significantly higher among children aged 12–23 months (84.4%) and 24–59 months (88.3%) compared with children below 12 months (56.2%, p≤0.001). Main reasons reported by caregivers for MOV were lack of vaccines (40.3%), reason unknown (31.2%) and not being informed (17.6%).ConclusionsAvoiding MOV should remain a priority in low-resource settings, in line with the new ‘Immunization Agenda 2030’. Children beyond their second year of life are particularly vulnerable for MOV. We strongly recommend assessment of eligibility for vaccination as routine healthcare practice regardless of the reason for the visit by screening vaccination card. Strengthening implementation of ‘Second year of life’ visits and catch-up activities are proposed strategies to reduce MOV."
Case Report: Psychotherapy of a 10-year-old Afghani refugee with post-traumatic stress disorder and dissociative absences,"Nastia Junod, Olga Sidiropoulou, Daniel S. Schechter",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.940862,2022-7-22,"['Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois', 'Université de Lausanne (UNIL)']",Article,1,Yes,"['Security and Conflict', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Mental Health', 'Migration']",,"The article explores the case of PTSD and related psychopathology in refugee children, using the example of a young Afghani boy, Mustafa, who immigrated to Switzerland after the violent loss of his father. This research is contextualized within the broader issues of war, terrorism, and the impact of violence on children, particularly refugees like Mustafa who face significant developmental challenges as a result of these traumas. PTSD in children like Mustafa can severely disrupt their emotional and social development and academic performance, compounding family stresses from shared traumatic experiences.

The purpose of this research is to illustrate how trauma-informed psychodynamic psychotherapy can help children reconstruct and understand their traumatic experiences to improve their psychological and social functioning. The study specifically focuses on the challenge of building a coherent trauma narrative and recovering intersubjective connections between the child and caregiver.

Using a case study method, the research employs a psychodynamic and trauma-informed approach in psychotherapy sessions. These sessions aim to help Mustafa make sense of his traumatic experiences through play, which serves as a critical communication tool in such therapeutic settings.

Findings from this study reveal the deep psychological impact of war and the associated violence, with Mustafa showing symptoms of PTSD, including dissociative symptoms like derealization and depersonalization. The therapy informed a gradual process where Mustafa could express and process his trauma through play, leading to an improvement in his symptoms over time.

The research does not deeply investigate the country-specific legal frameworks, institutions, and policies related to human rights, focusing more on the therapeutic processes and psychological aspects.

The authors conclude that psychodynamic psychotherapy can be effective in helping refugee children process traumatic experiences and develop better emotional and social skills. They recommend the use of trauma-informed models to assist children like Mustafa, emphasizing the psychotherapist's role as a ""mentalizing third"" to facilitate healing and relational repairs within families.

The study acknowledges limitations including the sensitivity of addressing traumatic experiences and the political climate impacting data availability and participant willingness, especially given the trauma's ongoing nature due to continuous conflict in Afghanistan.

The study's datasets are not publicly available to protect participant anonymity, and all findings reflect the authors' views without external conflicts of interest.","Violence-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the context of war and terrorism has become an increasingly pressing public health issue relevant to refugee children and families. PTSD and related psychopathology in children can adversely affect all domains of development and, in particular, interfere with learning and socialization. When the experience of violent trauma and related loss is shared with the entire family, resulting impairment and distress may prevent caregivers from being psychologically available to process their traumatized children’s emotional communication and otherwise meet their children’s developmental needs. When children suffer from PTSD, it may be impossible to put their experience and related thoughts and feelings into words, let alone a coherent narrative. The latter difficulty can be even more pronounced when the child displays dissociative symptoms, possibly signaling a dissociative subtype of PTSD. Thus, the narrative within the child’s play during psychotherapy becomes all the more important as an indicator of the child’s internal world. This case report is an example both of evaluation and of psychotherapy that is both psychodynamic and trauma-informed with a 10-year-old Afghani boy who suffered the violent loss of his father at age of 3 years, leading to his immigration to Switzerland. This paper addresses the question of how the psychotherapist can accompany the child through the elaboration of his trauma and how the therapist can contribute to the co-construction of a coherent narrative of the child’s experience and to the restoration of an intersubjective connection between the traumatized child and caregiver."
Afghan Health Related Concerns Following the US Withdrawal: Results of a Survey Given via Social Media,"Jaffer Shah, Asghar Shah, Ahmad Fahim Tokhi, Jordan Shedrow, Nicolas Hernandez, Joseph Varney, Pashton Qaderi, Seyed Javad Masoumi, Shohra Qaderi",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.905481,2022-7-14,"['Kateb Univesity', 'Afghanistan National Charity Organization for Special Diseases (ANCOSD)']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance', 'Human Rights']","['Mental Health', 'Migration']",,"**Summary:**

1. **Overview**: 
   The U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan, completed by August 30, 2021, marked the end of a 20-year presence and initiated a rapid power shift in the country. This period led to significant social and healthcare challenges for Afghans, exacerbating the country's existing issues worsened by decades of conflict.

2. **Purpose**:
   The research aimed to investigate the public health and social concerns of Afghans following the U.S. withdrawal, focusing on mental and physical health impacts across different demographics, primarily gender and ethnicity.

3. **Methods**:
   Researchers conducted an anonymous online cross-sectional survey in September 2021, distributed on social media platforms. The survey captured data from 1,646 respondents about health-related concerns and lifestyle changes post-withdrawal.

4. **Findings**:
   The survey revealed high levels of concern over physical and mental health, with a notable disparity between genders—49% of females reported extreme concern over the withdrawal compared to 22% of males. Lifestyle changes were reported by 80% of respondents, including job loss and reduced access to food and healthcare.

5. **Legal and Policy Framework Examination**:
   The study touches on the impact of reduced international support and aid withdrawal on Afghanistan's healthcare systems, compromising institutional frameworks previously bolstered by external funding and partnerships.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**:
   Authors conclude that the U.S. withdrawal has triggered profound socio-economic and health-related issues in Afghanistan. They recommend that future policies and research consider both short and long-term healthcare and humanitarian responses with international cooperation to alleviate the crisis.

7. **Limitations**:
   The study's limitations include potential biases due to self-selection, underrepresentation of women and certain ethnic groups, and the broader political instability affecting data reliability and comprehensive representation. The survey's design limits generalization due to respondent demographics and distribution methods.","BackgroundThe United States Armed Forces completed their withdrawal from Afghanistan on August 30th, 2021, ending 20 years of war in Afghanistan. This rapid timeline from announcement to withdrawal and subsequent power transfer had profound consequences on the Afghan people, particularly in the domains of health and healthcare.MethodsOn 15 September 2021, we posted an anonymous online cross-sectional survey on social media (Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp groups) to collect data about respondents from Afghanistan. Questions focused on COVID-19 symptoms, concerns, and individual care with a focus on changes related to the United States (US) withdrawal from Afghanistan. The form was composed of 17 questions which included multiple choice, single choice, and numeric options. All questions were optional including demographic data.ResultsOur survey yielded 1,074 responses from the Farsi version and 572 responses from the Pashto version for a total of 1,646 responses. 1,286 (80%) of respondents were in Afghanistan at the time of survey submission. Concerning the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, 26% (412) respondents were extremely concerned and 12% (181) were moderately concerned. A majority of respondents report concerns regarding mental health due to the US withdrawal. 27% (418) report extreme concern, 12% (186) report moderate concern, and 15% (229) report a little concern. There is a significant difference in the proportions of concern (for US withdrawal generally, as well as physical and mental health) across gender. 49% of Female respondents report extreme concern regarding the US withdrawal compared to 22% of Male respondents (P &amp;lt; 0.001). With respect to physical health concerns 36% of Females report extreme concern compared to 16% of Males (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Finally on the mental health concerns, 54% of Females report extreme concern compared to 22% of Males (P &amp;lt; 0.001).ConclusionThe results from this survey are susceptible to the possibility of internal validity and/or external validity. However, we are accepting of those possibilities considering this survey wasn't designed to be bulletproof, but rather serve as a voice for those who can't be heard and to inform the public of the hardships occurring across the globe due to a steadfast retraction of the US footprint from their soil. Our findings indicate salient changes and public health concerns among Afghans following the US withdrawal from the region. These concerns varied across gender and ethnic groups. Our findings may serve as the first step in addressing the health concerns of Afghans following two decades of US military presence. The results should be understood through the limitations associated with a survey study design. Future research and policy aimed at tackling short and long-term health and social concerns in Afghanistan should consider the role of US withdrawal."
"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices Toward Tuberculosis Among Hospital Outpatients in Kabul, Afghanistan","Mohammad Yasir Essar, Khalid Jan Rezayee, Shoaib Ahmad, Manar Ahmed Kamal, Reshaduddin Nasery, Tamim Jan Danishmand, Michael Head, Arash Nemat",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.933005,2022-7-11,"['University of Southampton, Faculty of Medicine', 'Afghanistan National Charity Organization for Special Diseases (ANCOSD)']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Disease Prevention', 'Migration']",,"**Summary of the Article on TB Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice in Kabul, Afghanistan**

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   Afghanistan has been experiencing significant political turmoil, particularly after the Taliban came to power. This has led to international sanctions, suspended funding, and disruption of healthcare services. Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health challenge, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic which diverted resources and led to under-reporting of cases.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards TB among hospital outpatients in Kabul, seeking to provide updated insights for local and international stakeholders and guide future research and public health interventions.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The research employed a cross-sectional descriptive study targeting adult outpatients in Kabul's public hospitals between January and March 2022. The study used non-probability convenient sampling to gather data from 829 participants, analyzing them with logistic regression models to identify predictors of KAP towards TB.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - A significant majority (87.7%) of participants had good knowledge, and 96.5% had a positive attitude towards TB treatment and control.
   - Young age, being male, and having a positive attitude were predictors of good TB knowledge.
   - Only 2 participants exhibited poor TB prevention practices.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   The study did not delve deeply into legal frameworks. However, it highlighted the deficiencies in healthcare infrastructure and services due to political upheaval, suggesting a lack of effective TB control policies under current governance.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The study affirmed that good KAP towards TB exists among the study population, recommending health promotion activities build on this knowledge. Future campaigns should consider the socio-economic circumstances of target communities. The authors call for further studies to gather comprehensive data from diverse Afghan populations, especially those in rural areas or among internally displaced persons.

7. **Study Limitations:**
   Limitations include the study’s confinement to Kabul, which may not reflect rural or diverse socio-cultural regions. The political climate and healthcare system disruption may affect the validity and generality of the results. The sampling method may also not fully represent the broader population.

The study serves as a foundational effort, offering crucial insights into TB-related KAP in Afghanistan amidst challenging times, and advocates for continued attention to public health education and research.","BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) is a high-burden respiratory infectious disease. There was a sharp decline in the number of confirmed TB cases during the pandemic; this is likely to be influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic response, with under-reporting due to resource diversion. There are typically 13,000 tuberculosis-associated deaths in Afghanistan annually, with significant problems posed by drug-resistant TB.MethodA cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in Afghanistan on Kabul residents who visited the adult outpatient departments of public hospitals for any health-related reason from 1st January to 20th March 2022. The study scored their knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) toward tuberculosis. The sample size was calculated using Epi-Info, and the minimum sample size was 385. The sampling method is chosen the non-probability convenient sampling for data gathering. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 28, and we used the Mann-Whitney test, Chi-square or fisher extract test, spearman correlations, and binary logistic regression model.ResultsOf 829 participants, 450 (54.3%) were males and 379 (45.7) females. The median age was 28 years, and 63.3% were married. Most participants were unemployed (75.5%), but 54% had a monthly income &amp;gt;3,000 Afghanis, indicating the reliance on family. By TB knowledge score, 727 (87.7%) participants had good knowledge, and 800 (96.5%) participants had a positive attitude toward treatment and control. Only 2 participants reported poor practices regarding prevention. Regarding the binary logistic regression, young age, being a male, belonging to the “1,000–3,000” Afghani monthly income category, and having a positive attitude were significant predictors of good TB knowledge (P-value = 0.009, 0.000, 0.003, and 0.009), respectively. A positive attitude was expected to have good knowledge 6.035 times more than a negative attitude (95% CI: 1.572–23.167).ConclusionThe study findings highlighted that outpatients in Kabul had good knowledge, attitude, and practice toward TB. More studies are needed to highlight KAP in different Afghan populations, including in other parts of the country."

From the Hindu Kush mountains to the Registan Desert, Afghanistan is a
diverse landscape where droughts, floods, conflict, and economic market
accessibility pose challenges for agricultural livelihoods and food
security. The ability to remotely monitor environmental conditions is
critical to support decision making for humanitarian assistance. The Famine
Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System
(FLDAS) global and Central Asia data streams provide information on
hydrologic states for routine integrated food security analysis. While
developed for a specific project, these data are publicly available and
useful for other applications that require hydrologic estimates of the water
and energy balance. These two data streams are unique because of their
suitability for routine monitoring, as well as for being a historical record for
computing relative indicators of water availability. The global stream is
available at ∼ 1-month latency, and monthly average outputs are on a
10 km grid from 1982–present. The second data stream, Central Asia (21–56∘ N, 30–100∘ E), at ∼ 1 d latency,
provides daily average outputs on a 1 km grid from 2000–present. This paper
describes the configuration of the two FLDAS data streams, background on the
software modeling framework, selected meteorological inputs and parameters,
and results from previous evaluation studies. We also provide additional
analysis of precipitation and snow cover over Afghanistan. We conclude with
an example of how these data are used in integrated food security analysis.
For use in new and innovative studies that will improve understanding of
this region, these data are hosted by U.S. Geological Survey data portals

"Facemask Usage among Pedestrians in Most Crowded Urban Districts of Kabul, Afghanistan, during the Third COVID-19 Wave: An Observational Study","Arash Nemat, Abdullah Asady, Ahmad Wali Ataye, Tamim Jan Danishmand, Mohammad Yasir Essar, Nahid Raufi",https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.21-1070,,"['Kabul University', 'Southern Medical University']",Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"ABSTRACT.
COVID-19 has spread worldwide since its emergence from Wuhan. In countries with a low vaccination rate, the use of facemasks is essential to limit the risk of COVID-19 transmission. We have conducted this study in June 2021 to estimate the prevalence of facemask usage, and investigate the use of different types of facemasks and their distribution among pedestrians in the most crowded urban districts of Kabul during the third COVID-19 wave in Afghanistan. Using a multistage sampling method, a total of 5,000 pedestrians were selected from five most crowded urban districts of the city. The data was gathered by an observational method. The percentage, mean, and standard deviation were used to describe the variables. The χ2 test analysis was used to assess the relationship between two categorical variables. Of the 5,000 observations, the most common age group was 10–39 years with high participation of male (87.2%). A total of 2,013 (40.3%) people used facemasks (95% CI). Females used facemasks significantly more than males (64.6% versus 36.7%, P &lt; 0.001). Among the pedestrians who used a facemask, most of them (88.6%) wore their facemask correctly. In conclusion, the prevalence of facemask use in Kabul was fairly low especially among elderly people (≥ 60 years). Hence, the observed rates probably cannot protect the community against COVID-19. Therefore, it is important to emphasize the public health recommendations via educational programs and national campaigns to support the strict use of facemasks in public places."
Tap Water Consumption Is Associated with Schoolchildren’s Cognitive Deficits in Afghanistan,"Abdullah Shinwari, Alain Véron, Mohammad Haris Abdianwall, Elisabeth Jouve, Remi Laporte",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19148252,2022-7-6,"['Aix Marseille Université', 'Nangarhar University']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Environment']","['Nutrition', 'Toxic Elements']",,"**Summary of the Article**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Afghanistan has been severely affected by ongoing war, instability, and weak governance, contributing to its position as one of the least-developed countries. Over half of the population lived below the poverty line between 2008 and 2019. Afghan children face numerous health challenges, including malnutrition and poor sanitation, which can impact their cognitive development.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions:**
   The study focused on investigating the impact of nutritional status, poverty, and environmental exposures on the cognitive development of children in Afghanistan. It addressed human rights issues such as access to adequate nutrition, clean environment, and education, which are crucial for children's development.

3. **Research Methods:**
   A cross-sectional study was conducted in Jalalabad among schoolchildren. Data were collected using descriptive statistics and statistical tests to compare schools and assess the relationship between IQ scores and various predictors, including environmental and socio-economic factors. The TONI-1 non-verbal IQ test was used to assess cognitive abilities.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The study found a significant prevalence of low IQ scores among children, particularly linked to tap water use and older age. Malnutrition was not a significant factor in this cohort; however, exposure to environmental pollutants from tap water and age-related stress affected cognitive development. A high proportion of children lived near roads or used traditional cosmetics that could contribute to cognitive impairment due to toxic exposure.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Institutions:**
   There was no specific examination of Afghanistan's legal frameworks in the article. However, it highlighted the lack of adequate infrastructure and policy to address water contamination and environmental pollutants affecting children's rights to health and development.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors concluded that low IQ scores are prevalent due to tap water contamination and cumulative stress due to age-related factors, suggesting urgent interdisciplinary research to identify and address trace metal exposure. They recommended launching long-term programs focusing on individual, mental health, and environmental concerns.

7. **Limitations:**
   The study was limited by its focus on only one city and potential biases due to the cultural context of IQ testing. Data on toxic metal exposure were not fully explored, highlighting a gap due to political instability and lack of national surveys. Additionally, the study acknowledged potential biases in interpreting IQ data across different cultural settings.

Overall, the study underscores significant challenges to children's rights in Afghanistan related to cognitive development and yields recommendations for further research and potential policy interventions.","Environmental influence on intelligence quotient (IQ) is poorly understood in developing countries. We conducted the first cross-sectional investigation to assess the role of socio-economic and environmental factors on schoolchildren’s IQ in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. A representative sample of 245 schoolchildren aged 7–15 was randomly selected in five schools. Children’s records included: non-verbal IQ TONI-1 scale, body mass index, socio-economic status, and further environmental indicators (water supply, proximity to a heavy-traffic road, use of surma traditional cosmetics). The mean age of the children was 11.7 years old (±2.0 years), and 70.2% and 29.8% were male and female, respectively. The children’s mean IQ was 83.8 (±12.6). In total, 37 (14.9%) of the children were overweight, 78 (31.5%) were living below the USD 1.25 poverty line, 133 (53.6%) used tap water supply, 76 (30.6%) used surma, and 166 (66.9%) were exposed to heavy road traffic. The children’s IQ was significantly and independently lowered by tap water use (−3.9; 95% CI [−7.1; −0.6]) and by aging (−1.4; 95% CI [−2.2; −0.6]), as revealed in multivariate analysis, independently of gender, socio-economic status, exposure to heavy road traffic, overweight status, and surma use. Lower IQ among older children is possibly attributed to chronic stress experienced by adolescents due to living conditions in Afghanistan. While using tap water prevents fecal peril, it may expose children to toxic elements such as lead which is known to lower their intellectual development."

"Prevalence of Poor Mental Health among Adolescents in Kabul, Afghanistan, as of November 2021","Sayed Jafar Ahmadi, Laura Jobson, Arul Earnest, Daniel McAvoy, Zeinab Musavi, Nasratullah Samim, Sayed Ali Akbar Sarwary",https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.18981,2022-6-23,['Kabul Medical University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Mental Health', 'Migration']",,"The article examines the mental health of adolescents in Afghanistan following the Taliban's return to power in August 2021, a significant historical and political turn after two decades of conflict involving the US and its allies. This backdrop of prolonged instability has severely impacted the psychological well-being of Afghan youth, with previous studies highlighting high incidences of psychiatric disorders among them, especially females and younger individuals.

The research aimed to assess current mental health conditions among Afghan adolescents and tackled pressing human rights concerns around the adequacy of mental health support in a conflict-ridden environment. It specifically explored the associations between sex and age and mental health outcomes in this demographic.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 376 adolescents (160 girls and 216 boys) recruited from a major high school in Kabul and through community outreach. The research employed standardized mental health questionnaires to determine probable cases of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. The data were analyzed using binary logistic regression to explore associations with sex and age.

Findings revealed that nearly 29% of participants were at significant risk of psychiatric disorders, with about 52% likely experiencing PTSD, 49% depression, and 45% anxiety. These rates were alarmingly higher than past reports, underscoring a dire mental health crisis among the youth. Females and younger adolescents were particularly vulnerable, with girls showing much higher prevalence rates across all measured disorders compared to boys.

The study implicitly critiques the inadequacy of Afghanistan's health system and diminished foreign aid in addressing these severe mental health needs, highlighting an urgent requirement for tailored interventions sensitive to the evolving sociopolitical landscape. It also underscores the importance of contextual understanding for clinicians treating Afghan adolescents, especially refugees, internationally.

However, the study faced notable limitations, stemming from its inability to employ random sampling due to security concerns, confinement to Kabul for sampling, challenges in recruiting female participants, and a cross-sectional design that precludes causal inferences. These factors, alongside the fluctuating political climate, restrict the study's generalizability and call for future longitudinal research to track mental health trends over time.",No abstract available

"Education, Age and Gender: Critical Factors in Determining Interventions for Child Brick Workers in Pakistan and Afghanistan","Catherine Pellenq, Laurent Lima, Susan Gunn",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116797,2022-6-2,['Laboratoire de Recherche sur les Apprentissages en Contexte'],Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Education']","['Gender', 'School Access']",,"The article examines the psychosocial impacts of child labor in brick factories in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with a focus on children's subjective well-being. Below is a summary based on the requested points:

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context**: Brick manufacturing involves significant child labor, despite laws against it, due to socio-economic constraints faced by disadvantaged families. The work is seen as a necessary economic contribution by families, in contexts where options are limited, illustrating the socio-political challenges in combating child labor.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions**: The research aims to identify which categories of child workers require urgent protection, in line with ILO Convention No. 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour. The study specifically investigates how work in brick factories affects the psychological health of child workers, addressing the human rights challenge of emotional and intellectual well-being in child labor.

3. **Research Methods**: The study used a dataset from a comparative occupational health study involving 936 children aged 11-17 years in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It employed Factorial ANOVAs to analyze the effects of work, age, gender, and education on children's psychosocial well-being. Participants were selected from brick factories and nearby communities, with ethical clearances obtained from both countries.

4. **Main Findings**: The study discovered that child workers exhibit higher negative emotions, feelings of mistreatment, and weaker senses of personal security compared to non-working peers. Girls were more adversely affected than boys, and factors like education and age influenced outcomes differently across genders.

5. **Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies**: While the article discusses ILO conventions and local laws against child labor, challenges remain in enforcing these laws due to economic and cultural factors influencing family decisions.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The study suggests a causal link between work and deteriorating psychological health among child workers. It recommends further research on gender-specific impacts and the role of education. Enhancing educational interventions is crucial, as education can variably protect or challenge well-being, especially in specific cultural contexts.

7. **Limitations**: Limitations include weak explanatory power due to intra-group variations, regional instability, and data gaps on schooling and socio-economic factors. The need for qualitative methods and a broader psychosocial evaluation is emphasized to fully comprehend the intricacies of child labor's psychological impact. Pandemic-related and regional instability challenges halted parts of the research.

This study underscores the importance of considering psychosocial well-being in addressing child labor, advocating tailored interventions that account for personal and contextual factors influencing child workers.","Working in factories fashioning bricks by hand seems the epitome of hazardous child labor. Yet, efforts to remove children from this work have shown little success; impoverished families balance the value of their children’s contribution against the risks they see. Unfortunately, psychosocial impacts are often not visible, and are rarely taken into consideration when designing interventions. A comprehensive occupational health study of children working in brick factories included a module on psychosocial risks and impacts. This analysis reports on the Pakistan and Afghanistan portion of the study which was administered to 450 child brick workers and 486 controls, aged 11–17. Factorial ANOVAs confirmed that working in brick factories was the strongest predictor of respondent’s psychosocial health. However, they also identified subgroups of children that escape this prediction. Older girls, for example, actually felt better when working, compared with staying at home. Schooling had positive associations, especially in younger boys and adolescent girls. In fact, the results of this study showed that those who are at greatest psychosocial risk were girls who do not go to school. These findings underscore the importance of assessing psychosocial impacts and tailoring policy and interventions to specific gender and age categories of young workers."
Health Help-Seeking Behavior: The Scavengers’ Perspective,"Beenish Malik, Novel Lyndon, Yew Wong Chin, Basharat Hussain, Sehrish Malik",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116457,2022-5-26,['University of Management and Technology Lahore'],Article,1,Yes,"['Humanitarian and Development Assistance', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Disease Prevention', 'Migration']",,"**Summary**

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:** The study focuses on Afghan scavengers in Gujrat, Pakistan. The influx of Afghan refugees began with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, leading many to seek refuge in Pakistan. Due to socio-economic marginalization, Afghan refugees often take up scavenging—a hazardous but low-skill job—because it requires no formal education or special training.

2. **Purpose of the Research:** The study aims to explore the help-seeking behavior of Afghan scavengers and identify factors affecting their health service utilization. It addresses challenges related to access to healthcare and the specific health service utilization patterns among scavengers using Andersen’s Behavioral Model of Health Service Use (ABM).

3. **Research Methods:** Relying on a qualitative descriptive design, the study utilized semi-structured interviews with 31 Afghan scavengers in Gujrat. The research employed thematic analysis to interpret the data. The interviews were conducted in Urdu, translated into English, and analyzed using NVivo software. The method also involved purposive and snowball sampling techniques to identify participants.

4. **Main Findings:** The scavengers tend to delay seeking professional medical help, often resorting to self-medication, and using small private clinics due to proximity and affordability. Public hospitals are less preferred due to distance, long waiting times, and perceived discriminatory treatment. Private specialized hospitals are seldom used due to high costs. There is a prevalent belief that minor ailments should be ignored until they significantly disrupt daily activities.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:** While not explicitly detailed, the study hints at the lack of inclusive health policies for Afghan refugees in Pakistan, which aggravates their marginalization and contributes to reliance on informal healthcare solutions.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:** The authors conclude that economic constraints, healthcare accessibility, cultural beliefs, and perceived discrimination significantly affect health-seeking behaviors. Recommendations may include creating targeted health interventions, improving accessibility to public health services, and fostering culturally sensitive healthcare practices to better serve marginalized populations like Afghan scavengers.

7. **Limitations:** The study's limitations stem from potential recruitment difficulties due to political sensitivity surrounding Afghan refugees, challenges in data collection, and the lack of a formal ‘gatekeeper’ among scavengers, which could limit the generalizability of findings. Additionally, translating cultural nuances from Urdu to English posed challenges in conveying the complete essence of the participants' experiences.","Scavengers are prone to various health problems, hence seeking healthcare is inevitable. Despite the importance of the help-seeking behavior of scavengers, it has not been addressed explicitly in the existing literature. Addressing this gap, this study intends to explore the help-seeking behavior of scavengers and to identify the factors that influence healthcare utilization among them. This qualitative study conducted thirty-one in-depth interviews through a semi-structured interview guide and analyzed them using thematic analysis. Andersen’s Behavioral Model of Health Service Use was employed to explore the findings. The findings showed that the scavengers utilized multiple healthcare options depending on the severity and reoccurrence of the illness. The process of help-seeking and health services utilization was largely influenced by the cost of the health service, long distance to the health facility, traveling cost and waiting time. The study highlights the need for scavengers’ enrolment in micro health insurance schemes. The initiative would facilitate scavengers’ access to medical care. Health awareness campaigns and the provision of free mobile medical services, especially at the landfill sites, would also improve curative treatment among scavengers."

The study addresses human rights concerns related to healthcare access and children's welfare.

3. **Research Methods**: The article uses existing data on measles cases, malnutrition rates, and healthcare system challenges, synthesizing information from various health organizations and historical records to outline the current crisis.

4. **Main Findings**: The study found a significant rise in measles cases, linked to decreased vaccination rates due to the pandemic's impact on healthcare priorities. Malnourished children are more susceptible to contracting measles, leading to higher mortality rates. The socioeconomic disparities between urban and rural areas further exacerbate these health issues.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The study notes that international sanctions and political decisions by the Taliban have impacted funding and healthcare programs. This highlights the need for transparent and effective policies that separate health aid from political issues.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors recommend revitalizing the Afghan healthcare system through training and funding for healthcare workers and separating healthcare aid from political contexts. They also stress the importance of combining measles vaccinations with vitamin A supplementation and encourage agricultural improvements in rural areas to address food insecurity.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The article acknowledges limitations due to insufficient epidemiological data, especially testing in rural areas, and the political challenges of engaging with the Taliban government. The shift of resources toward COVID-19 has further complicated measles surveillance and vaccination efforts.

Overall, the study underscores the urgent need for integrated humanitarian and health responses to address the intertwined crises of measles and child malnutrition in Afghanistan amidst ongoing political and economic challenges.",No abstract available
Persistence of headache and its relation to other major sequelae following traumatic brain injury at 2–8 years after deployment-related traumatic brain injury in veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq wars,"James R. Couch, Kenneth E. Stewart",https://doi.org/10.1111/head.14303,2022-5-11,['University of Oklahoma College of Medicine'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"AbstractObjectiveThis study deals with headache in relation to other major sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan wars over 8 years after experiencing a deployment‐related TBI (DTBI).BackgroundTBI occurred in 14%–23% of veterans deployed to the Iraq or Afghanistan campaigns. This study evaluates sequelae of TBI (STBI) over 1–8 years after a DTBI.MethodsThis is a secondary, cross‐sectional analysis of previously collected data, which was taken from review of medical records of the first 500 veterans with a DTBI seen in the TBI clinic of the Oklahoma City Veterans Health Center. This report deals with five of the most common STBIs and represents the presence and severity of, or absence of, the particular symptom at the time of a patient’s initial visit to the clinic. All subjects were evaluated between June 1, 2008, and April 30, 2011. The STBI used here include: headache, dizziness, balance, coordination difficulties, and difficulty with decisions. In the TBI clinic, the burden of these symptoms was evaluated with a Likert Scale of none, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe. For this report, the scale was compressed into three categories: none, mild/moderate, and severe/very severe. Data were complete for age at TBI and mechanism of TBI in 500 subjects, for symptom severity in 497 subjects, for TBI severity in 491 subjects, and for presence of prior TBI in 496 subjects.ResultsFor the 497 subjects with complete symptom severity data, headache was seen in 476 (95.8%) and absent in 21 (4.2%). Regarding headache severity, 236 (47.5%) reported mild/moderate and 240 (48.3%) reported severe/very severe headache burden. For other sequelae, including severity of dizziness, balance, and coordination problems, these symptoms were absent in 85 (17.1%), 85 (17.1%), and 106 (21.3%) patients, respectively; of mild/moderate severity in 356 (71.6%), 355 (71.4%), and 321 (64.6%) patients; and of severe/very severe intensity in 56 (11.3%), 57 (11.5%), and 70 (14.1%) patients. Difficulty with decisions, which was used as an indication of cognitive difficulty, was noted in 429 (86.3%) of the subjects, of which 252 (50.7%) noted mild/moderate and 177 (35.6%) severe/very severe intensity. To evaluate changes over time, the subjects were divided into 2‐year cohorts of 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, and 7–8 years since DTBI. Comparing symptom burden within these four 2‐year cohorts, there was no statistically significant change in symptom burden analyzing by time interval from DTBI to TBI clinic evaluation. For analysis by severity of the DTBI in 491 subjects with complete data, categories were constructed based on alteration of consciousness (AOC) or duration of loss of consciousness (LOC) as follows: AOC (264/491 [53.8%]); LOC &lt;1 min (95/491 [19.4%]); LOC, 1–30 min (115/491 [23.4%]); and LOC &gt;30 min (17/491 [3.5%]). The proportion of subjects with severe/very severe symptom intensity increased as the severity of the DTBI increased (from p = 0.043 to p = 0.001). Additional evaluations included groupings by age at DTBI (20–29, 30–39, and ≥40 years), by presence or absence of a TBI prior to the DTBI, and by causation of the DTBI (blast or direct head trauma). No significant differences were observed with any of these comparisons.ConclusionFor veterans experiencing a DTBI, these TBI‐related sequelae persist with little improvement over time up to 8 years. A trend toward symptoms becoming worse as DTBI severity increased was observed. Headache was the most frequent sequela of TBI, occurring in 96% of the patients with almost half of these reporting severe/very severe intensity of headache burden. The basis for the prolonged persistence of these STBI is not known."

The country's slew of issues has paved the way for HIV to spread and go unchecked. International groups have banded together to stop the virus's spread since the first case was confirmed in Afghanistan. The cumulative effects of international collaboration have aided in the reduction of cases and improved awareness. Because of their injection use, a large portion of the country's population has been classified as a vulnerable category for HIV infection. Awareness campaigns and international collaboration should be implemented to further limit the spread of HIV."
Resettling Afghan and Iraqi interpreters employed by Western armies: The Contradictions of the Migration–Security Nexus,Sara de Jong,https://doi.org/10.1177/09670106211050811,2021-12-2,['University of York'],Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available," This article develops a novel analytical framework for capturing the multiple, competing configurations that the migration-security nexus invokes in discourse and practice, combining insights from critical migration and security scholarship. The framework’s application is illustrated with an empirical case study of the protection and relocation of Afghan and Iraqi former local interpreters and other locally employed civilians working for Western armies. The analysis demonstrates that locally employed civilians (LECs) are simultaneously considered security actors in the East and security risks in the West, the ‘best and brightest’ causing brain drain and potential terrorists when crossing borders, both ‘model migrants’ and threats to western values. By uncovering the nexus’s multiple configurations and its contradictions, the framework supports the project of denaturalizing the migration-security nexus, while also showing that the discourses and practices justified through its various configurations include the legitimation of border violence and the denial of protection to migrants.

Sociocultural Determinants of Attitudes Toward Domestic Violence Among Women and Men in Afghanistan: Evidence from Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey 2015,"Mohammad Fazel Akbary, Tolulope Ariyo, Quanbao Jiang",https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260520980400,2020-12-18,"[""Xi'an Jiaotong University"", 'Bamyan University']",Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available," Domestic violence (DV), also commonly referred to as intimate partner violence or spousal abuse, is a global public health issue that affects the physical, psychological, sexual, and reproductive health of women. We examined the sociocultural factors associated with the attitude toward DV perpetrated against women in Afghanistan. We used data from the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey, consisting of an ever-married sample of 29,461 women and 10,760 men aged 15 to 49 years. Our dependent variable, attitude toward DV, was determined from responses on acceptance of wife-beating in five scenarios, and the group of socio cultural factors was selected based on evidence from previous studies. Our main analytical method was logistic regression, using the survey design. Our findings indicated that factors such as an increase in years of education and living in a wealthier household reduce the likelihood of acceptance of DV among men and women. Ethnicity was also associated with the attitude toward DV, but the magnitude varied across ethnic groups and gender. Furthermore, an increase in age and living in the urban area were associated with nonjustification of DV among women, but not among men. On the other hand, frequent exposure to the media increases the likelihood of acceptance of DV among men, but not for women. The result of the present study suggests that there are economic, social, and cultural aspects to the attitude toward DV among men and women in Afghanistan. Therefore, policies designed at changing the socio cultural perception of the people are of importance in other to bring about a change in attitude, and even combat the prevalence of DV. "

Despite international efforts, the country faces ongoing violence, poor living conditions, and socio-cultural challenges. These factors have heavily impacted the mental health of its citizens, particularly youth.

2. **Purpose**: The research aims to understand the mental health (depression and anxiety) of the first generation of young adults growing up under the post-Taliban government. It focuses on how war experiences and daily stressors affect mental health in relation to demographics such as sex, age, and ethnicity.

3. **Methods**: A cross-sectional study surveyed 621 high school students in Mazar-e-Sharif using instruments like the Afghan War Experiences Scale and the Afghan Daily Stressors Scale, alongside the Hopkins Symptom Checklist for depression and anxiety. 

4. **Findings**: The study found a significant association between poor mental health and higher exposure to war experiences, irrespective of age and ethnicity. Girls reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, and daily stressors than boys, who reported more war experiences. The socio-cultural context in Afghanistan significantly influences these outcomes.

5. **Legal Frameworks**: The study references Afghanistan's Labor Law, which restricts child labor, suggesting gaps between legislation and societal practices due to socio-economic pressures.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that daily stressors are stronger predictors of mental health issues than direct war experiences and recommend school-based interventions to address these challenges. They emphasize the need to consider socio-cultural factors when developing strategies to support the mental health of Afghan youth.

7. **Limitations**: The study highlights limitations such as its focus on school-attending youths, potential lack of data on non-school attending children, and the applicability of survey tools developed in different contexts. The sensitivity of discussing mental health issues in Afghanistan and the lack of knowledge about participants' socio-economic and psychiatric background also posed challenges.","ObjectivesThe specific objectives of the study are to examine the mental health (depression and anxiety) of the first generation of post-Taliban government and compare these measures with its preceding generation, and to assess war experience of the first generation of post-Taliban government. We also wanted to assess the daily stressors and their contribution to the mental health, and to assess mental health as a result of war experiences and daily stressors with respect to demographic measures such as sex, marital status, age, mother's age, birth order, and ethnicities.MethodsIn a cross-sectional design, 621 high school students, were randomly selected to participate in the study to assess war experience, daily stressors, and mental health among the first generation of young adults under post-Taliban government.ResultsThe participants had 17.37 ± 0.9 mean years of ages, 94.8% of them were unmarried. Poor mental health was significantly associated with higher exposure to war, but not with the age of participants (P = 0.08). There was no association between war experiences and the age and ethnicity of our participants (p = 0.9, p = 0.7). Age differences were negligible for daily stressors too (P = 0.07). Daily stressors scores were higher for female than male students (P = 0.02). The majority of young adults surveyed, declared themselves in agreement with statements such as the security situation in Afghanistan makes me frustrated (56%), air pollution as a concern (41%), and not having anyone to talk about what is in their heart (28.8%). Gender differences were highly significant for mental health, as appraised by both The Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HSCL) –depression and HSCL-anxiety. Girls presented higher rates of depression, anxiety, and daily stressors than boys, and boys presented higher rates of war experiences than girls.ConclusionWar experience, daily stressors, and mental health were irrelevant with age, ethnicity and marital status. Factor such as being the first-born child of the family, higher reported war experiences, and daily stressors all negatively impact mental health. Alongside war and its direct effects, the existing socio-cultural context must be considered as a potential factor mediating the mental health of girls in Afghanistan."

Access to Services from Persons with Disabilities in Afghanistan: Is Community Based Rehabilitation Making a Difference?,"Jean-Francois Trani, Kyle A. Pitzer, Juanita Vasquez Escallon, Parul Bakhshi",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19106341,2022-5-23,"['Washington University in St. Louis, George Warren Brown School of Social Work']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Access to Healthcare', 'Disability Rights', 'Social Inclusion']",,"### Summary

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR) was introduced by the World Health Organization after the 1978 Declaration of Alma-Ata as a strategy for improving access to healthcare in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). This aligns with the 2006 UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which aims for full and equal enjoyment of human rights for persons with disabilities. In many LMICs, people with disabilities face significant barriers, including poverty, poor healthcare access, and social exclusion.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges:**
   The study explored the effectiveness of CBR programs in providing service access and addressing unmet needs among persons with disabilities in Afghanistan. It focused on various rights-related challenges such as healthcare access, education, inclusion in employment, and reducing discrimination and stigma.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study utilized a large quasi-randomized field experiment approach, applying Propensity Score Matching (PSM) combined with Difference-in-Differences (DD) to evaluate the impact of the CBR program. The research involved interviews and structured questionnaires, collecting data over several years from program participants and a control group across various Afghan provinces.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - CBR participation improved access to services such as physical therapy, assistive devices, employment, and education compared to the control group, reducing unmet needs in healthcare, education, and social inclusion.
   - The program showed significant benefits in fostering inclusion through advocacy and community support, thereby reducing stigma and discrimination.
   - Despite improvements, females and poorer individuals with disabilities faced additional barriers, and stigma remained.

5. **Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies:**
   The study highlighted the alignment of CBR with the UNCRPD principles, promoting multisectoral approaches and community engagement to meet the rights of persons with disabilities.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors concluded that CBR programs significantly enhance service access and reduce unmet needs for people with disabilities. They recommended continued advocacy to tackle stigma and promote early intervention and inclusive environments, emphasizing the importance of program sustainability and the involvement of local communities.

7. **Limitations:**
   The quasi-experimental nature presented challenges like potential selection bias and information bias, particularly due to data collection by CBR workers. The geographic coverage might have influenced outcomes due to existing differences between participant and control locations. Political conditions, such as the Taliban regime, might exacerbate gender inequality and material deprivation, affecting future program impact.","The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), ratified in 2006, states that the achievement of equal rights, empowerment, and social inclusion of people with disabilities requires comprehensive rehabilitation services involving educational, social, economic, and medical interventions, all dimensions of the World Health Organization Community based rehabilitation (CBR) matrix. CBR programs aim at achieving those goals. In the present study, we investigated whether a large scale CBR program is improving access to multiple services (namely physical therapy, assistive technology, education, employment, advocacy, and community awareness) and providing satisfactions (by measuring the reduction in unmet needs) of Afghans with disabilities. We enrolled in the study 1861 newly recruited CBR participants with disabilities from 169 villages between July 2012 and December 2013, and 1132 controls screened with disabilities randomly selected with a two-stage process within 6000 households from 100 villages in the same provinces as the CBR but outside its catchment area. Using propensity score matching (PSM) and difference in difference analysis, we estimated the differences in accessing services. There were statistically significant differences between participants and controls on the access of available services between the baseline and endline. Using PSM we also found that needs were more often met among CBR participants compared to the controls. Our study indicates that a CBR program may be an effective way to provide services for persons with disabilities even in a conflict context such as Afghanistan. It contributes to addressing the longstanding question whether CBR can actually improve the rehabilitation of persons with disabilities."
Mobile phone data reveal the effects of violence on internal displacement in Afghanistan,"Xiao Hui Tai, Shikhar Mehra, Joshua E. Blumenstock",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-022-01336-4,2022-5-12,['UC Berkeley School of Information'],Article,1,Yes,"['Security and Conflict', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Military Actions', 'Migration']",,"Here's a summary of your request covering the key points:

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context**: Afghanistan has been plagued by ongoing conflict, with violence impacting civilians and causing displacement. This backdrop influences the need for understanding the dynamics of violence and its impact on displacement within the country.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions**: The study aims to investigate the impact of violent conflicts on internal migration, focusing on specific human rights challenges such as forced displacement due to armed conflict. It seeks to identify patterns and drivers behind migration linked to human rights violations.

3. **Research Methods**: The authors use data from the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset combined with mobile phone call detail records (CDRs) from a major Afghan telecom provider. They apply statistical models to analyze the relationship between violent events and migration patterns, taking measures to ensure subscriber privacy in their data analysis.

4. **Main Findings**: The study identifies a strong correlation between violent events and increased migration from affected districts. It highlights the displacement effect of such events, showing a measurable rise in out-migration following violence, particularly from areas frequently experiencing conflict.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The article does not explicitly delve into Afghanistan's legal frameworks or policies related to human rights, focusing instead on empirical data analysis to assess trends in displacement linked to conflict.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: Authors conclude that violence significantly drives internal migration in Afghanistan. They suggest that understanding these dynamics can aid humanitarian responses and policy-making tailored to manage displacement more effectively.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study acknowledges several limitations, including potential data bias toward populous regions, the challenge of correlating CDRs directly with displacement, and constraints in data granularity. Additionally, it notes that some migration events captured in the data may not directly indicate displacement due to the lack of contextual information. The sensitive political climate and challenges in accurate data reporting in conflict zones also restrict the study's comprehensiveness.","AbstractNearly 50 million people globally have been internally displaced due to conflict, persecution and human rights violations. However, the study of internally displaced persons—and the design of policies to assist them—is complicated by the fact that these people are often underrepresented in surveys and official statistics. We develop an approach to measure the impact of violence on internal displacement using anonymized high-frequency mobile phone data. We use this approach to quantify the short- and long-term impacts of violence on internal displacement in Afghanistan, a country that has experienced decades of conflict. Our results highlight how displacement depends on the nature of violence. High-casualty events, and violence involving the Islamic State, cause the most displacement. Provincial capitals act as magnets for people fleeing violence in outlying areas. Our work illustrates the potential for non-traditional data sources to facilitate research and policymaking in conflict settings."

Spousal violence against women in Afghanistan: Bivariate mapping of correlates,Masood Ali Shaikh,https://doi.org/10.47391/JPMA.22-62,2022-5-11,[],Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Culture, Society, and Heritage']","['Gender', 'Traditional Practices']",,"**Summary of the Article:**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Afghanistan has a complex socio-cultural landscape deeply rooted in traditional norms where women's rights issues, particularly domestic violence, have been prevalent. The societal acceptance of spousal violence and historical norms have made addressing these issues particularly challenging.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   This research aims to explore the prevalence of spousal violence in Afghanistan and its correlation with societal attitudes towards such violence. Specifically, it investigates human rights questions surrounding the acceptance and normalization of domestic abuse against women.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study utilizes data from the 2015 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of Afghanistan. It calculates the provincial prevalence of spousal violence and examines two correlates: witnessing paternal violence and acceptance of spousal violence. Bivariate mapping is used to illustrate the relationships between these variables.

4. **Main Findings:**
   There are significant variations in the prevalence of spousal violence across different provinces in Afghanistan. A notable correlation exists between women who have witnessed their father beating their mother and the acceptance of spousal violence. The study highlights a strong association between the prevalence of spousal violence and its societal acceptance.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies:**
   While the article points out the need for a paradigm shift in legal, social, and cultural frameworks to improve women's quality of life and rights, it does not provide a detailed analysis of the current legal structures. It implies that existing frameworks are insufficient in addressing the issue effectively.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that addressing spousal violence in Afghanistan requires significant changes in legal, social, and cultural paradigms. There is a need for enhancements in women's social status and their human rights protections. The study emphasizes better marital quality of life as essential for safeguarding women's rights.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The study's limitations include the reliance on data from 2015, which may not reflect current trends. Additionally, given Afghanistan's sensitive political climate, data accessibility and the ability to conduct comprehensive studies might be constrained. The socio-political instability could also impact the generalizability and applicability of the findings.","genesis to deeply entrenched socio-cultural norms. In this study 2015 Demographic and Health Survey data for Afghanistan was used to calculate the provincial prevalence and two correlates of spousal violence, and their bivariate mapping. Large differences were present in the provincial prevalence of spousal violence, having witnessed their father ever beat their mother, and acceptance of spousal violence by the currently or ever married women aged 15-49 years. In general, bivariate maps showed strong associations between spousal violence against women, its acceptance by women, and having witnessed their father beat their mother by ever married women. In an easily comprehensible manner, these maps underscore ensuring better quality of life in marital settings, higher and more equal social stature of women, and protecting their basic human rights would entail legal, social, and cultural paradigm shift.&#x0D;

Highlighting the forgotten: Tuberculosis amidst the humanitarian crisis and COVID-19 in Afghanistan,"Mohammad Yasir Essar, Arash Nemat, Shoaib Ahmad, Ahsan Zil-E-Ali, Roy Rillera Marzo, Michael Head",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103671,,"['Kabul University', 'Afghanistan National Charity Organization for Special Diseases (ANCOSD)']",Letter,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Nutrition', 'COVID-19', 'Disease Prevention', 'Food Security']",,"The article discusses the severe humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, focusing on health concerns such as malnutrition and infectious diseases underpinned by socio-political upheaval and systemic healthcare challenges:

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context**: Afghanistan is experiencing a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by the withdrawal of U.S. and international forces and the ascendancy of the Taliban. This new political climate has led to reduced international funding and logistical support, intensifying health system fragility.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Questions**: The study explores the escalating public health emergency in Afghanistan, specifically the surge in tuberculosis cases amid broader socio-political unrest. It raises concerns about human rights, particularly regarding healthcare access and gender equity, as women face more significant barriers to healthcare.

3. **Research Methods**: The study synthesizes data from national statistics and international reports to assess healthcare challenges, focusing on tuberculosis and its interaction with the COVID-19 pandemic.

4. **Main Findings**: Afghanistan faces a dire public health crisis with increased tuberculosis cases and drug-resistant strains, exasperated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Taliban's return has compounded healthcare access issues, especially for women, while stigma surrounding diseases further impedes timely medical intervention.

5. **Legal Framework and Policies**: The article implies a lack of adequate legal structures to ensure equal healthcare access. The cessation of international aid drastically reduced health services, particularly affecting 'Sehetmandi,' the largest health provider.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors recommend increased collaboration between Afghanistan's government and international entities like WHO and UNICEF. Ensuring gender-equitable healthcare access, continuing tuberculosis and COVID-19 control programs, and enhancing healthcare worker support are deemed crucial for mitigating ongoing health crises.

7. **Study Limitations**: Limitations stem from Afghanistan's unstable political climate and healthcare data scarcity. Ongoing unrest challenges data collection and intervention implementation. The report stresses sensitivity in engaging with Taliban authorities to facilitate health program continuation.",No abstract available

Descriptive epidemiology of the prevalence of adolescent active travel to school in Asia: a cross-sectional study from 31 countries,"Rizka Maulida, Erika Ikeda, Tolu Oni, Esther M F van Sluijs",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057082,2022-4-7,"['Universitas Indonesia', 'University of Cambridge']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Environment']","['Disease Prevention', 'Sustainability']",,"### Summary of the Article:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The article discusses the global issue of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like cancers, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and chronic respiratory illnesses, highlighting the importance of physical activity in adolescence as a preventive measure. Asia, as the most populous continent with rapidly urbanizing environments, faces unique challenges for promoting physical activity due to issues like high air pollution.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research aims to analyze the prevalence of Active Travel to School (ATS) among adolescents across 31 Asian countries and territories, examining how factors like age, sex, and BMI affect these patterns. It addresses challenges in generating evidence for policies to improve adolescent physical activity amidst barriers like urbanization and pollution.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study compiled data from 31 Asian countries to assess ATS prevalence, looking for trends related to demographics such as age, sex, and BMI. It compared existing data from diverse sources to form a comprehensive analysis for the region.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - ATS levels differ across Asia and are influenced by factors like gender and socio-economic status, with boys and adolescents from less wealthy areas more likely to engage in ATS.
   - Environmental factors like shorter distance to school and favorable settings (e.g., street design, tree cover) positively impact ATS rates.
   - There is a noted lack of specific regional data across Asia, especially by BMI and subregions.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   The study does not delve deeply into specific legal frameworks but highlights the need for policy interventions tailored to the unique urban and environmental challenges of Asia.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors suggest that interventions to promote ATS need to be informed by regional data and account for factors like built environments and pollution. Improved infrastructure and regional-specific policies would help overcome barriers to physical activity among adolescents.

7. **Limitations:**
   The study notes the scarcity of comprehensive data on ATS across Asia, partly due to variations in study methodologies. Limitations also stem from political and environmental challenges such as differing data collection standards and the pervasive issue of air pollution, which impacts feasibility and advisability of outdoor activities.","ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine the prevalence of adolescent active travel to school (ATS) across 31 countries and territories in Asia, overall and by age group, sex and body mass index (BMI) category.DesignCross-sectional study.Setting31 Asian countries.Participants152 368 adolescents aged 13–17 years with complete data for age, sex, measured weight and height and active travel to school from 31 Asian countries from the Global School-based student Health Survey (GSHS).Primary outcomeSelf-reported active travel to school categorised into passive (0 days) and active (1–7 days).ResultsOverall prevalence of adolescent ATS in Asia based on random-effect meta-analysis was 55%, ranging from 18% (UAE) to 84% (Myanmar). There was limited subregional variation: 47% in the Eastern Mediterranean (EM), 56% in the South East Asia and 64% in the Western Pacific. Summarised by random-effect meta-analysis, being an older adolescent aged 16 years and older (vs younger age below 16 years: OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.16) was positively associated with ATS. This association was strongest in EM countries. Summarised by random-effect meta-analysis, females (vs males: OR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.71 to 0.89) and adolescents with overweight/obesity (vs underweight and normal BMI: OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86 to 0.99) were less likely to use ATS. Association with sex was strongest in EM countries. Heterogeneity was considerable in all meta-analyses.ConclusionThe prevalence of adolescent ATS in Asia varies substantially. Overall, older and male adolescents, and adolescents with underweight and normal BMI category are more likely to actively travel to school. However, the main contributor to differences in ATS between and within regions remain unknown. Although there is substantial scope for improving ATS rates in Asia, any policy actions and interventions should be cognisant of local built, social and natural environmental contexts that may influence active travel behaviour."
Information Operations Increase Civilian Security Cooperation,"Konstantin Sonin, Austin L Wright",https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueab101,2021-12-30,"['The University of Chicago', 'HSE University']",Article,1,Yes,,,['Not available'],Not available,"Abstract
               Information operations are considered a central element of modern warfare and counter-insurgency, yet there remains little systematic evidence of their effectiveness. Using a geographic quasi-experiment conducted during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, we demonstrate that civilians exposed to the government’s information campaign resulted in more civilian security cooperation, which in turn increased bomb neutralisations. These results are robust to a number of alternative model specifications that account for troop presence, patrol-based operations, and local military aid allocation. The paper demonstrates that information campaigns can lead to substantive attitudinal and behavioural changes in an adversarial environment and substantially improve battlefield outcomes."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Afghanistan has struggled with high maternal mortality rates, with the maternal mortality ratio reaching 638 per 100,000 live births in 2017, one of the highest in the region. Despite available interventions to lower these rates, utilization of maternal healthcare services is insufficient, particularly in rural and low-resource areas.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The study aimed to assess the magnitude of health facility deliveries and identify associated factors in the 12th district of Kandahar city, Afghanistan. It addresses the human rights challenge of maternal health and safe childbirth, highlighting the gap in access to adequate healthcare.

3. **Research Methods**: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted using stratified systematic random sampling of 850 households. Data was collected through surveys from women who had given birth within the past two years. Analysis involved bivariate and multivariable logistic regression.

4. **Main Findings**: Despite moderate improvements due to government and international efforts, the proportion of births in health facilities was lower than the national average. Key predictors of health facility delivery included antenatal care (ANC) visits, husbands' education level, and a history of complications in previous births. A significant number of women still delivered at home due to transportation, long distances to facilities, and poor health service quality.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The study does not delve into the country's legal frameworks, institutions, or policies in detail but implies deficiencies in healthcare accessibility and education influence maternal health outcomes.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The study concludes that strategies to improve maternal health should target increasing ANC utilization and male involvement in maternal health decisions. Policy efforts must address accessibility and awareness to optimize health facility delivery rates.

7. **Limitations**: Limitations include the study's cross-sectional design, potential recall bias, and its focus on an urban area limiting generalizability. The study also suggests cultural factors might affect healthcare utilization, indicating the need for qualitative research. The political climate and instability in Afghanistan can affect data collection and healthcare delivery.","
            Background:
            Maternal mortality and morbidity are increasing public health concerns in Afghanistan. Even more worrying is maternal death due to causes that can be prevented through maternal healthcare services utilization during pregnancy and delivery.
          
          
            Objectives:
            We sought to investigate the magnitude of women giving birth in a health facility and its associated factors in the 12th district of Kandahar city, Kandahar province, Afghanistan.
          
          
            Materials and Methods:
            A community-based cross-sectional study of women who gave birth in the last 2 years in the 12th district of Kandahar city was conducted in early 2021. We used a systematic random sampling method to enroll 850 women. We collected data on sociodemographics, reproductive characteristics, and delivery practices of respondents. Factors associated with health facility delivery were identified using a multivariable logistic regression model.
          
          
            Results:
            The proportion of women who gave birth at health facilities was 71.8% (confidence interval [CI]; 68.61%–74.77%). In this study, health facility delivery was associated with husbands’ education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.07, 95% CI: 1.50–6.31), antenatal care (ANC) services utilization (AOR = 17.84, 95% CI: 11.86–26.8), and history of complications in previous births (AOR = 3.65, 95% CI: 2.32–5.74).
          
          
            Conclusion:
            In this study, the utilization of a health facility for delivery was slightly lower than reported on the national level. Our study found potential factors such as ANC visits, husbands’ education, and history of complications in previous births, for which interventions aimed at enhancing the proportion of health facility deliveries.

Between and Within-Country Variations in Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices in South Asia,"Md. Tariqujjaman, Md. Mehedi Hasan, Mustafa Mahfuz, Tahmeed Ahmed, Muttaquina Hossain",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19074350,2022-4-5,['International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Nutrition', 'Maternal Health', 'Food Security']",,"The article discusses disparities in Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices within South Asian Countries (SACs), namely Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan. Here's a summary following your requested points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: South Asia is a critical region for child nutrition, with nearly half of the world's undernourished children residing there. Suboptimal feeding practices continue to challenge the region, prompting research into factors influencing IYCF practices.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The study aims to explore disparities in WHO's core IYCF indicators across SACs and identify sociodemographic inequalities. It seeks to provide actionable insights to improve IYCF practices and address nutritional deficiencies in children.

3. **Research Methods**: The study used data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between 2015-2018 across six SACs. It employed statistical analyses, such as chi-square and ANOVA tests, to assess variations in IYCF indicators based on socio-demographic factors like wealth, mother's education, residence, and child’s gender.

4. **Main Findings**: The research revealed significant disparities in IYCF practices across different socio-economic groups. Breastfeeding practices were prevalent in poorer households, while wealthier families exhibited better complementary feeding. There was inadequate initiation and maintenance of recommended feeding practices, with Maldives generally performing the best among SACs and Pakistan and India needing improvements.

5. **Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies**: The article notes that most SACs have laws against unethical breast milk substitute marketing, but enforcement is weak due to budget and manpower constraints. The Maldives' national nutrition strategies provide an exemplary framework that other countries could adopt.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The study suggests enhancements to national IYCF policies, particularly in countries performing poorly like Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India. Recommendations include strengthening market monitoring mechanisms, providing better education on IYCF, and developing interventions targeted at vulnerable groups.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The research faced data constraints, excluding countries like Bhutan and Sri Lanka due to DHS data restrictions. Political instability and economic factors in some SACs may also hinder comprehensive data collection and effective policy implementation.

This comprehensive study highlights the need for region-specific strategies and policies to improve nutrition and IYCF practices in the SACs, addressing both the disparities and common challenges in these contexts.","This study aimed to explore variations in Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices between different South Asian Countries (SACs) and within their sociodemographic characteristics including place of residence, mother age, mother education, child sex, and wealth quintiles within the SACs. We extracted 0–23 months age children’s data from the nationally representative survey of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan. Among all SACs, the early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF) practice was 45.4% with the highest prevalence in the Maldives (68.2%) and the lowest prevalence in Pakistan (20.8%). Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) practice was 53.9% with the highest prevalence in Nepal (67%) and the lowest prevalence in Afghanistan (42%). Only 13% of children had a minimum acceptable diet (MAD), with the highest prevalence in the Maldives (52%) and the lowest prevalence in India (11%). We found higher IYCF practices among the mothers with secondary or higher levels of education (EIBF: 47.0% vs. 43.6%; EBF: 55.5% vs. 52.0%; MAD: 15.3% vs. 10.0%), urban mothers (MAD: 15.6% vs. 11.8%), and mothers from the richest households (MAD: 17.6% vs. 8.6%) compared to the mothers with no formal education or below secondary level education, rural mothers and mothers from the poorest households, respectively. Mothers from the poorest households had better EIBF, EBF, and continued breastfeeding at 1-year (CBF) practices compared to the mothers from the richest households (EIBF: 44.2% vs. 40.7%; EBF: 54.8% vs. 53.0%; CBF: 86.3% vs. 77.8%). Poor IYCF practices were most prevalent in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India."
Association between Mother’s Education and Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices in South Asia,"Md. Tariqujjaman, Md. Mehedi Hasan, Mustafa Mahfuz, Muttaquina Hossain, Tahmeed Ahmed",https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14071514,2022-4-5,['International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh'],Article,1,Yes,"['Education', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Higher Education', 'Nutrition', 'Maternal Health']",,"1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The article focuses on South Asian countries (SACs) where poor nutritional status and suboptimal infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices are prevalent. Historical and socio-economic challenges, coupled with high rates of undernutrition in children, highlight the region's urgent need for improved health practices.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The study aimed to explore the association between mothers' education levels and the World Health Organization's (WHO) IYCF core indicators in SACs. The research addresses the challenge of suboptimal feeding practices in SACs and examines how mothers' education impacts these practices, providing policymakers with insights for designing intervention strategies.

3. **Research Methods**: The study utilized generalized estimating equation (GEE) models to analyze both pooled and country-specific data from six South Asian countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan. The analysis controlled for variables such as mothers' age, children's age, sex, place of residence, and wealth index. Sensitivity analyses were performed using data from mothers’ education as a continuous variable.

4. **Main Findings**: Key findings indicate a positive association between higher education levels in mothers and improved IYCF practices across SACs, except for continued breastfeeding at one year. However, negative associations were found in Bangladesh for early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF) and in Pakistan for exclusive breastfeeding (EBF). Socioeconomic factors and cultural practices influence these outcomes, pointing to specific areas for policy attention.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: While the study does not directly analyze legal frameworks, it implies the need for robust policies supporting maternal education as a pathway to improving child nutrition. It underscores the importance of educational initiatives and healthcare policies tailored towards enhancing maternal education and nutrition awareness.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that increased maternal education directly correlates with improved IYCF practices, recommending that SAC policymakers promote and sustain education through secondary levels. They suggest interventions like prenatal counseling, community mobilization, and mass media campaigns to enhance feeding practices and reduce cesarean deliveries when unnecessary.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The main limitations include its cross-sectional design, which limits causal inferences, and reliance on mothers' 24-hour dietary recall, which may introduce recall bias. The exclusion of Bhutan and Sri Lanka due to data limitations also affects the comprehensiveness of the regional analysis. The study suggests that future research could benefit from longitudinal data to reinforce causal linkages between education and feeding practices.","The association between mother’s education and the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) eight Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) core indicators has yet to be explored in South Asia (SA). This study aimed to explore the association between mother’s education and the WHO’s eight IYCF core indicators in SA. We analyzed data from the most recent nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys of six South Asian Countries (SACs)—Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan. We found significantly higher odds (adjusted odds ratio, AOR, 1.13 to 1.47) among mothers who completed secondary or higher education than among mothers with education levels below secondary for the following seven IYCF indicators: early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF), exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months (EBF), the introduction of solid, semisolid or soft foods (ISSSF), minimum dietary diversity (MDD), minimum meal frequency (MMF), minimum acceptable diet (MAD), and consumption of iron-rich or iron-fortified foods (CIRF); the exception was for the indicator of continued breastfeeding at one year. Country-specific analyses revealed significantly higher odds in EIBF (AOR 1.14; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.18) and EBF (AOR 1.27; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.34) among mothers with secondary or higher education levels in India. In contrast, the odds were lower for EIBF in Bangladesh and for EBF in Pakistan among mothers with secondary or higher education levels. For country-specific analyses for complementary feeding indicators such as ISSSF, MDD, MMF, MAD, and CIRF, significantly higher odds (AOR, 1.15 to 2.34) were also observed among mothers with secondary or higher education levels. These findings demonstrate a strong positive association between mother’s education and IYCF indicators. Strengthening national policies to educate women at least to the secondary level in SACs might be a cost-effective intervention for improving IYCF practices."

Due to the drastic effect, COVID‐19 scientists are trying to work on pandemic diseases and Governments are interested in the development of methodologies that will minimize the losses and speed up the process of cure by providing vaccines and treatment for such pandemics. The development of a new vaccine for any pandemic requires long in vitro and in vivo trials to use. Thus the strategies require understanding how the pandemic is spreading in terms of affected cases and casualties occurring from this disease, here we developed a forecasting model that can predict the no of cases and deaths due to pandemic and that can help the researcher, government, and other stakeholders to devise their strategies so that the damages can be minimized. This model can also be used for the judicial distribution of resources as it provides the estimates of the number of casualties and number of deaths with high accuracy, Government and policymakers on the basis of forecasted value can plan in a better way. The model efficiency is discussed on the basis of the available dataset of John Hopkins University repository in the period when the disease was first reported in the six countries till the mid of May 2020, the model was developed on the basis of this data, and then it is tested by forecasting the no of deaths and cases for next 7 days, where the proposed strategy provided excellent forecasting. The forecast models are developed for six countries including Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Iran, Italy, and China using polynomial regression of degrees 3–5. But the models are analyzed up to the 6th‐degree and the suitable models are selected based on higher adjusted R‐square (R2) and lower root‐mean‐square error and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The values of R2 are greater than 99% for all countries other than China whereas for China this R2 was 97%. The high values of R2 and Low value of MAPE statistics increase the validity of proposed models to forecast the total no cases and total no of deaths in all countries. Iran, Italy, and Afghanistan also show a mild decreasing trend but the number of cases is far higher than the decrease percentage. Although India is expected to have a consistent result, more or less it depicts some other biasing factors which should be figured out in separate research."

"To sustain maternal and newborn health in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime, midwifery must be prioritised","Esther Sharma, Sebera Turkmani, Diane Duclos, Natasha Howard",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.o653,2022-3-11,['London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine'],Editorial,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Human Rights']","['Maternal Health', 'Gender', 'Gender Apartheid']",,"### Summary of the Article

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The article discusses the impact of the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021 on maternal and newborn health. Historically, during Taliban control from 1996 to 2001, Afghanistan witnessed some of the worst maternal and newborn health outcomes globally. Women faced severe restrictions, contributing to high maternal mortality rates and limited access to reproductive health services. Post-2001, significant health gains were achieved due to international support and the expansion of midwifery, although the situation remained fragile due to ongoing security issues and donor dependency.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges:**
   The research aims to address the current and future challenges faced by maternal and newborn health services in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime. It focuses on potential setbacks to human rights, particularly the rights of women to access education and healthcare, and the broader impact on women's public life and employment opportunities.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study involves a historical analysis of maternal and newborn health trends in Afghanistan, examining the effects of political changes and international interventions since 2001. It also reviews recent policy statements by the Taliban regarding women's roles in society and healthcare.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - The Taliban's restrictions on women severely threaten the progress made in maternal and newborn health.
   - There are indications that the Taliban plans to limit women's employment roles and their ability to work alongside men.
   - Educational opportunities for girls are severely restricted, complicating future midwifery training.
   - International funding has been frozen, damaging the healthcare system's capacity and leading to significant workforce reductions.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Institutions:**
   The article highlights the fragile state of Afghanistan's health system, dependent on international donor support. The current legal and institutional frameworks under the Taliban lack transparency and commitment to sustaining public health, particularly for women.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that global support is crucial to sustain maternal and newborn health in Afghanistan. Recommendations include ensuring midwives are paid, maintaining healthcare facilities, scaling up midwifery education, and strictly monitoring international aid distribution to prevent corruption and ensure effective use.

7. **Limitations:**
   The study is limited by the uncertain political climate under the Taliban, potential biases in data collection due to restricted access, and the sensitivity of addressing women's rights in an oppressive regime.

                Background
                Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) cause more than 70% of deaths worldwide and share modifiable risk factors including obesity and metabolic abnormalities. Over the past 15 years, many changes in lifestyle, dietary patterns, physical activity, and socioeconomic status have been observed in the Afghan population. This study aims to investigate which specific lifestyle factors, dietary patterns, and characteristics of Westernization are associated with an increased risk of being overweight or obese and with poor metabolic health in the Afghan population.
              
                Methods
                A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted where a total of 729 male and female participants were recruited. Face-to-face interviews and anthropometric measurements were conducted by trained health staff using standardized questionnaires which included information on socio-demographic and housing characteristics, income, occupation, ethnicity, personal and family medical history, stress, anthropometry, diet, and physical activity. Bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) was used to estimate body composition, including overall body fatness. Physical activity was measured using the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). For a comprehensive assessment of dietary intake, a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) specific to the Afghan population was developed which included all local food items relevant to the population. Lipid profile and fasting glucose were measured in a local laboratory. Biospecimens were collected using dried blood spots (DBS) and dried stool cards to perform microbiome and biomarker-based research.
              
                Discussion
                This is the first study which will assess dietary patterns, lifestyle factors, and their association with obesity and metabolic health in Afghanistan. Such a study will aid the development of dietary and lifestyle guidelines in Afghanistan which will promote better health and educate people to make healthy food choices. The findings will also help in designing and implementing effective public health strategies to promote a healthy lifestyle and prevent the epidemic of overweight and obesity, and, hence, reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases in the region.

Gaps in the continuum of care among people living with HIV in Afghanistan,"Mohammad Zubair Harooni, Abdul Alim Atarud, Ehsanullah Ehsan, Ajmal Alokozai, Willi McFarland, Ali Mirzazadeh",https://doi.org/10.1177/09564624211055299,2021-12-15,['United Nations Development Programme'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"Background Afghanistan adopted a “test and treat” strategy for all people living with HIV (PLWH) in 2016. In this study, we presented demographic and clinical characteristics of all people diagnosed between 2013 and 2019 and evaluated progress towards 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets and identified program gaps among PLWH in Afghanistan diagnosed in 2018. Methods We used clinical, behavioral, and demographic data from national HIV surveillance for 1394 patients diagnosed from 2013 through 2019. We also tracked 184 patients diagnosed with HIV in 2018 over 15 months to assess their enrollment in care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, retention on ART, and viral suppression. Results Of 1394 patients diagnosed from 2013 through 2019, 76.0% were male, 73.7% were older than 24 years, and 33.4% acquired HIV through heterosexual sex. Of the 184 patients diagnosed in 2018, 94.6% were enrolled in care, 88.6% received ART, 84.2% were retained on ART for at least 12 months, and 33.7% received a viral load test. Of those with a viral load test, 74.2% were virally suppressed. Patients who were 35–44 years old (52.0%, p-value .001), acquired HIV through unsafe injection (62.5%, p-value .413), were co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) (60.0%, p-value .449), and with CD4 &gt; 500 at diagnosis (64.7%, p-value .294) were less likely to be virally suppressed 12 months after diagnosis. Conclusion Nearly 95% of people diagnosed with HIV in Afghanistan in 2018 were linked to care and nearly 90% were on ART. Viral testing and viral suppression remain low with notable disparities for middle-aged patients, and possibly for those who injected drugs. Addressing barriers to HIV programs in Afghanistan, particularly for people who inject drugs (PWID), are urgently needed to reach the 90-90-90 global targets. Surveillance data on the number of people with undiagnosed HIV is needed to assess the first 90 target. "

The Association Between Child Marriage and Domestic Violence in Afghanistan,"Mavra Qamar, M. Anne Harris, Jordan L. Tustin",https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260520951310,2020-8-28,['University of Toronto'],Article,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available," Child marriage and intimate partner violence have been globally recognized as human rights violations. Both indicators can derail an individual’s future and have various public health implications. Previous studies have shown an association between child marriage and domestic violence in low- and middle-income countries; however, data in Afghanistan are not known. This study aimed to assess the association between child marriage and domestic violence in Afghanistan. We used nationally representative data collected by the Demographic and Health Surveys to conduct logistic regression analyses. Child marriage was separated into three categories: very early marriage (&lt;15 years), early marriage (15–17 years), and adult marriage (≥18 years). Domestic violence was the response variable and was assessed as any violence, physical violence, emotional violence, and sexual violence. Of the sample ( N = 21,324), 15% of the respondents were married before the age of 15; 35% were married between the ages of 15 and 17; and 50% were married as adults. After adjusting for current age, place of residence, and socioeconomic status, the odds of sexual violence were 22% higher among women who married before age 15 compared with those married as adults (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = [1.05, 1.40], p = .005). However, the odds of reporting any violence, physical violence, and emotional violence among those who married as children did not differ compared with those who married as adults. This may be due to a shift in traditional norms or underreporting in Afghanistan. This study adds to the body of research on child marriage and intimate partner violence, and specifically provides novel information on this association in Afghanistan. "

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   - The article outlines Afghanistan's current humanitarian crisis, exacerbated by the Taliban’s takeover, ongoing civil unrest, and violent attacks. This situation has arisen amidst decades of conflict and instability, severely impacting various sectors, with healthcare being notably affected.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Questions:**
   - The research aims to highlight the mental health challenges faced by healthcare workers (HCWs) in Afghanistan. It addresses the urgent human rights challenge of ensuring adequate mental health support for those who are vital in delivering healthcare amidst scarce resources and the systemic neglect of HCWs' well-being.

3. **Research Methods:**
   - While the article does not detail specific methodological approaches, it appears to rely on observational data and the analysis of current conditions to highlight the ongoing struggles of HCWs in Afghanistan's deteriorating healthcare landscape.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - The findings reveal that HCWs in Afghanistan face significant mental health issues due to the compounded effects of civil unrest, economic hardship, and an overwhelming lack of resources. This situation is part of a larger trend of mental health neglect in crisis zones.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   - The article implicitly touches on the failure of existing frameworks and policies to protect HCWs and provide necessary mental health support, calling for both government and international bodies to step up their efforts.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - The authors conclude that immediate, collaborative action from both the Afghan government and international organizations is essential to address the economic and psychological needs of HCWs. They recommend the introduction of targeted mental health interventions and greater support for these frontline workers.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   - The study's limitations include potential biases due to the political climate, challenges in data availability, and the sensitivity of discussing human rights in a region under the Taliban government. The precarious political environment makes gathering comprehensive data and implementing solutions particularly difficult.","AbstractAfghanistan's humanitarian crisis has severely impacted the mental health of frontline workers. With the introduction of the Taliban government, ongoing civil unrest, and other forms of violent attacks, healthcare workers (HCWs) continue to provide patient care despite minimal resources. A severe contraction in the economy, poor supply of medications, political turmoil, and insufficient humanitarian aid have added to pre-existing problems. High levels of insecurity and instability as well as decades of traumatic experiences have contributed to increasing mental health challenges amongst frontline workers. Despite the scarcity of mental health services, HCWs continue to persevere with their service to the community. However, inadequate interventions may have serious implications for HCWs bearing the brunt of multiple traumas. Thus, governmental and international involvement is needed to address both the economic and psychological needs of HCWs in Afghanistan."

Inequalities in full vaccination coverage based on maternal education and wealth quintiles among children aged 12-23 months: Further analysis of national cross-sectional surveys of six South Asian countries,"Kiran Acharya, Dinesh Dharel, Raj Kumar Subedi, Asmita Bhattarai, Yuba Raj Paudel",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046971,2022-2-7,['New ERA'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Human Rights']","['Disease Prevention', 'Maternal Health', 'Migration']",,"**Summary**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   South Asia has dense cultural and economic ties, with high mobility across borders, such as the open border policy between Nepal and India facilitating movement for livelihood and life events. Achieving high vaccination coverage is critical for community protection in this interconnected region, yet there is limited comparative data on vaccination coverage and inequalities across South Asian countries.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Questions:**
   The research aims to compare full vaccination coverage among South Asian countries, focusing on inequalities defined by socioeconomic factors such as household wealth and maternal education. It addresses challenges in meeting universal health coverage goals, particularly in ensuring equitable access to vaccine-preventable disease protection for children.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study utilizes data from recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in six South Asian countries (Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, Afghanistan, and Pakistan). It calculates full vaccination coverage and inequalities using the Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and the Relative Index of Inequality (RII), with logistic regression analysis to assess the impact of maternal education and wealth quintiles on vaccination rates.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The study revealed significant disparities in full vaccination coverage, which ranged from 46% in Afghanistan to 84% in Bangladesh. It's observed that maternal education is a more potent factor in inequitable vaccination coverage than household wealth. Pakistan and Afghanistan showed the most significant inequalities by both maternal education and wealth, while Nepal and Maldives had the lowest inequality.

5. **Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies:**
   The study highlights the importance of national health policies focusing on reaching disadvantaged groups. Countries like Bangladesh leverage a pluralistic health system to improve vaccination, while programs like ‘Reaching Every Community’ in Nepal emphasize equitable vaccine distribution.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that full vaccination coverage in South Asia is inadequate, with pronounced inequities driven primarily by maternal education in some countries and household wealth in others. They recommend targeted interventions to improve education and economic status, implement community-specific strategies, and engage religious and community leaders to boost vaccination rates in resistant areas.

7. **Study Limitations:**
   Limitations include the potential recall bias due to reliance on maternal reporting for vaccination data, differences in health systems, and varying demand for vaccination services not captured. There's also challenge in making cross-country comparisons due to different data collection methodologies and country-specific factors like leadership and topography. The cross-sectional nature of the data restricts establishing causal relationships.","ObjectiveThis study was conducted to compare full vaccination coverage and its inequalities (by maternal education and household wealth quintile).DesignThis further analysis was based on the data from national-level cross-sectional Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) from six countries in South Asia.SettingWe used most recent DHS data from six South Asian countries: Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and the Maldives. The sample size of children aged 12–23 months ranged from 6697 in the Maldives to 628 900 in India.Primary and secondary outcome measuresTo measure absolute and relative inequalities of vaccination coverage, we used regression-based inequality measures, slope index of inequality (SII) and the relative index of inequality (RII), respectively, by maternal education and wealth quintile.ResultsFull vaccination coverage was the highest in Bangladesh (84%) and the lowest in Afghanistan (46%), with an average of 61.5% for six countries. Pakistan had the largest inequalities in coverage both by maternal education (SII: −50.0, RII: 0.4) and household wealth quintile (SII: −47.1, RII: 0.5). Absolute inequalities were larger by maternal education compared with wealth quintile in four of the six countries. The relative index of inequality by maternal education was lower in Pakistan (0.5) and Afghanistan (0.5) compared with Nepal (0.7), India (0.7) and Bangladesh (0.7) compared with rest of the countries. By wealth quintiles, RII was lower in Pakistan (0.5) and Afghanistan (0.6) and higher in Nepal (0.9) and Maldives (0.9).ConclusionsThe full vaccination coverage in 12–23 months old children was below 85% in all six countries. Inequalities by maternal education were more profound than household wealth-based inequalities in four of six countries studied, supporting the benefits of maternal education to improve child health outcome."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Afghanistan has faced prolonged conflicts that have significantly impacted its social structures, including gender relations. Women in Afghanistan often face severe restrictions and social pressures, contributing to the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV).

2. **Purpose of the Research**: This study conducts a secondary analysis of the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic Health Survey (AfDHS) to examine the prevalence and determinants of IPV among ever-married women aged 15-49 years. The research addresses challenges surrounding the prevalence of physical, psychological/emotional, and sexual violence, focusing on various socio-demographic and contextual factors that may influence IPV.

3. **Research Methods**: The study uses data from the AfDHS 2015, employing logistic regression analysis to explore associations between IPV and various independent variables such as women’s decision-making capacity, education levels, place of residence, age, wealth, occupation, number of children, region, partner's alcohol consumption, and attitudes toward IPV. Analyses were conducted using STATA software, focusing on the subset of ever-married women.

4. **Main Findings**: The study highlights pervasive IPV in Afghanistan, with a significant portion of women reporting experiences of physical, emotional, or sexual violence. The analysis revealed distinct associations between IPV and factors such as low educational attainment, limited decision-making capacity, and acceptance of IPV as justified under certain circumstances. Women in rural areas and those with partners who consume alcohol are more likely to experience IPV.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: While the study does not provide an extensive examination of Afghanistan's legal frameworks, it implicitly suggests gaps in legal protection and enforcement related to women's rights and IPV prevention.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that IPV is a critical human rights issue in Afghanistan, influenced by various socio-cultural and economic factors. They recommend targeted interventions, such as educational programs to shift attitudes toward IPV, empowering women in decision-making, and enhancing legal responses to IPV.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study's limitations include potential underreporting of IPV due to cultural stigma and fear of repercussions, limited data scope to only ever-married women, and reliance on self-reported data, which may be biased. Additionally, the study's ability to influence changes is constrained by the broader socio-political environment in Afghanistan, which may impede the implementation of recommended interventions.","AbstractIntimate partner violence (IPV) is one of the most prevalent forms of violence that women suffer globally. Women in Afghanistan have been exposed to high levels of IPV which coincided with high levels of conflict during more than four decades. We cross-sectionally examined the Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey responses of 21,234 ever-married Afghan women. We first performed the frequency distribution analysis to determine the prevalence of IPV and the basic socio-demographic characteristics of the participants. Subsequently we examined the relationship between the independent and dependent variables followed by the bivariate and survey versions of logistic regression analyses. We report odds ratios in order to depict the strength and direction of the associations between the IPV and selected independent variables. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The analyses showed that 55.54% of Afghan women experienced some form of physical, emotional, or sexual violence by their intimate partners during the recall period partners. The most common form of IPV found was physical violence (50.52%). Factors such as being exposed to inter-parental violence (respondent woman’s father physically abused her mother) (adjusted OR= 3.69, CI= 3.31–4.10) and respondent’s acceptance of IPV (aOR= 1.85, 1.51–2.26) were associated with increased exposure to IPV. Having a spouse with at least a primary education (aOR= 0.76, CI= 0.64–0.91) or a respondent with at least a primary education (aOR= 0.82, CI= 0.68–0.98) was associated with lower exposure to reported IPV. The lifetime experience of IPV occurs to a high extent among Afghan women, and several socio-demographic factors have predisposing attributes. IPV policy formulation and strategizing may benefit from considering these factors."

Building resilience in US military families: Why it matters,"Alicia Gill Rossiter, C G Ling",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001735,2021-3-30,['University of South Florida Health'],Review,0,No,,,['Not available'],Not available,"Service members and their families have endured significant stressors over the past 19 years in support of the nation’s engagement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ‘Resilience’ is the term most commonly used to describe the military spouse and military-connected child. However, due to a paucity of research on military families, little is known about the impact of spousal/parental military service on the military family. The ability of the healthcare provider is critical to ensuring the success of the military spouse and military-connected child. Providers can support the physical and psychological health needs of military families through (1) identification of military family members in clinical practice and (2) providing culturally competent care that correlates the unique lifestyle and physical and psychological health exposures associated with spousal/parental military service. Historically, in the United States, there has been a proud legacy of generational military service in families—upwards of 80% of new recruits have a family member who has served in the military. The leading factor associated with retention of the service member on Active Duty or in the Reserve or National Guard is the satisfaction of the at-home spouse. Disenfranchising the military spouse and lack of services and support for military-connected children could create a gap in meeting recruitment goals creating a threat to national security in the United States."
"Health-related quality of life in refugee minors from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan resettled in Sweden: a nation-wide, cross-sectional study","Øivind Solberg, Mathilde Sengoelge, Charisse M. Johnson-Singh, Marjan Vaez, Anna-Karin Eriksson, Fredrik Saboonchi",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-021-02050-8,2021-3-22,"['Swedish Red Cross University College', 'Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies']",Article,1,Yes,"['Humanitarian and Development Assistance', 'Human Rights']","['Migration', 'Mental Health']",,"The article examines the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of refugee minors resettled in Sweden, comparing their well-being to a European age- and gender-matched reference population. This area of research is vital given the increased mental health risks faced by young refugees, as highlighted in prior studies focusing on forced migration and psychosocial adjustment.

1. **Context**: The study focuses on refugee minors from Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq who have resettled in Sweden, offering insights into their experiences and challenges. This demographic is relevant due to historical and ongoing conflicts in their home countries, which have led to significant refugee flows.

2. **Purpose**: The study aims to assess HRQoL among these minors and explore the associations between sociodemographic factors and HRQoL scores, addressing specific challenges such as social integration, psychological wellbeing, and family economic conditions.

3. **Methods**: HRQoL was measured using the KIDSCREEN-27 questionnaire, validated across cultures. The study included a randomized sample of refugee minors and compared their results to a European reference group.

4. **Findings**: Refugee minors reported lower HRQoL, particularly in psychological well-being and peer support, but higher scores in autonomy and school environment. Unaccompanied minors fared worse across several HRQoL dimensions, likely due to psychological stress and a lack of familial support. Economic stability and family cohesion were significant for better HRQoL. Afghan minors scored lower than those from Iraq and Syria, partially due to being more likely unaccompanied.

5. **Legal and Institutional Examination**: The study highlights the impact of Swedish residential care, which may provide comparable support in physical well-being and education to family homes. However, broader systemic issues like prolonged asylum processes impact mental health.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The findings suggest a need for more comprehensive support systems tailored to the unique needs of refugee minors, considering factors from pre-flight conditions to resettlement. This includes legal, economic, and educational assistance, as well as interventions beyond psychotherapeutic approaches.

7. **Limitations**: The study was limited by potential selection bias, as only a fraction of invited minors participated, possibly leading to an overestimation of HRQoL. The classification of ""unaccompanied"" might have included minors traveling with non-guardian relatives, potentially underestimating the associated stresses. Additionally, differences in economic conditions between home and host countries were not assessed. The political climate and challenges in reaching this population also impacted data collection and representation.

In summary, the study reveals the complex interplay of factors affecting HRQoL among refugee minors, emphasizing the need for a holistic and culturally sensitive approach to improving their mental and social well-being in host countries like Sweden.","Abstract
                Purpose
                To examine health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in refugee minors resettled in Sweden and compare results to a European reference population, while exploring associations between sociodemographic factors and HRQoL dimensions.
              
                Methods
                A cross-sectional, nation-wide study was conducted with a stratified sample of refugee minors ages 12–15 and 16–18 from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, resettled in Sweden between 2014 and 2018. HRQoL was measured using KIDSCREEN-27. HRQoL dimension scores of the sample were compared to mean scores of European age and gender-matched reference population. Associations between sociodemographic factors and HRQoL dimensions were investigated with independent t tests and ANOVA. A multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the sociodemographic factors associated with HRQoL.
              
                Results
                The questionnaire was sent to 10,000 potential respondents. The response rate was 26%, yielding n = 2559 refugee minors (boys 55%, girls 45%) in the study sample. Compared to European references, minors in the present study had significantly lower scores of HRQoL within psychological wellbeing and peers and social support, whereas levels for autonomy and parent/guardian relations and school environment were higher. Several sociodemographic factors were significantly associated with all HRQoL dimensions, with those 16–18 years old, having average or poor family economy, and living with an unrelated adult or family reporting lower levels of HRQoL. Minors from Afghanistan had significantly lower scores of HRQoL for all dimensions compared to those from Iraq and Syria.
              
                Conclusion
                Refugee minors had significantly lower levels of HRQoL for psychological wellbeing and peers and social support compared to European references. Future research should further investigate this potential HRQoL gap further.

"Enhancing quality midwifery care in humanitarian and fragile settings: A systematic review of interventions, support systems and enabling environments","Caroline SE Homer, Sabera Turkmani, Alyce N Wilson, Joshua P Vogel, Mehr Gul Shah, Helga Fogstad, Etienne V Langlois",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006872,2022-1-20,['Burnet Institute'],Review,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Maternal Health', 'Migration']",,"### Summary:

#### 1. Historical, Political, or Social Context:
The article discusses the importance and challenges of providing quality midwifery services in humanitarian and fragile settings (HFS), where a significant portion of the world's population resides. These settings are often characterized by conflict, displacement, and inadequate infrastructure, which severely affect maternal and child health outcomes. As of 2020, around 23% of the global population was estimated to be living in such environments. Women and children bear the brunt of these challenges, with health facilities often non-functional and a lack of access to trained midwives.

#### 2. Purpose of the Research:
The research aims to systematically review literature on the quality of midwifery services in HFS. It seeks to analyze evidence to inform future solutions that enhance midwifery care quality, addressing pressing human rights challenges related to health access for women and children in these regions.

#### 3. Research Methods:
The study conducted a mixed-methods systematic review, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative data from peer-reviewed primary research articles. Eligible studies from 1995 to 2020 were reviewed, focusing on settings classified across various levels of fragility. This narrative synthesis approach combined different research methods to highlight key issues impacting midwifery services.

#### 4. Main Findings:
- **Human Rights Violations and Trends**: The review identified serious barriers, including safety and security concerns, cultural and gender norms, and insufficient infrastructure and supplies, which prevent midwives from delivering necessary services.
- **Impact on Health Outcomes**: Increases in midwifery coverage could substantially reduce maternal and neonatal deaths. However, insecurity, inadequate workforce planning, and lack of professional support undermine this potential.
- **Community Involvement**: Community engagement emerged as a critical factor in improving service provision and building trust between midwives and the populations they serve.

#### 5. Examination of Legal Frameworks:
The study highlights the need for specific policies to protect midwives in HFS. International humanitarian and human rights laws underline the obligation to protect health workers, rights that some domestic laws also recognize. UN Security Council Resolution 2286 in 2016 condemned attacks against health workers in conflict situations, providing a legal basis for advocacy and policy development.

#### 6. Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:
The authors conclude that creating an enabling environment, enhancing support systems, and ensuring safety and security for midwives are crucial for improving midwifery services in HFS. They recommend strengthening community engagement, further integrating midwives into leadership roles, and aligning with international frameworks to safeguard midwives' rights and professional development.

#### 7. Limitations of the Study:
The study faces limitations due to the political climate and safety issues in HFS, which may affect data availability and reliability. The sensitive nature of human rights in these areas poses challenges for obtaining comprehensive and accurate information, making it difficult to implement widespread evidence-based solutions.","IntroductionWomen and children bear a substantial burden of the impact of conflict and instability. The number of people living in humanitarian and fragile settings (HFS) has increased significantly over the last decade. The provision of essential maternal and newborn healthcare by midwives is crucial everywhere, especially in HFS. There is limited knowledge about the interventions, support systems and enabling environments that enhance midwifery care in these settings. The aim of this paper is to identify the factors affecting an enabling environment for midwives in HFS and to explore the availability and effectiveness of support systems for midwives.MethodsA structured systematic review was undertaken to identify peer-reviewed primary research articles published between 1995 and 2020.ResultsIn total, 24 papers were included from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Sudan, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Uganda and Liberia. There were two broad themes: (1) the facilitators of, and barriers to, an enabling environment, and (2) the importance of effective support systems for midwives. Facilitators were: community involvement and engagement and an adequate salary, incentives or benefits.

"Health conditions of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers on search and rescue vessels on the central Mediterranean Sea, 2016-2019: A retrospective analysis","Elburg van Boetzelaer, Adolphe Fotso, Ilina Angelova, Geke Huisman, Trygve Thorson, Hassiba Hadj-Sahraoui, Ronald Kremer, Anna Kuehne",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053661,2022-1-11,['Medecins Sans Frontieres'],Article,1,Yes,"['Humanitarian and Development Assistance', 'Healthcare and Public Health']","['Migration', 'Disease Prevention', 'Maternal Health']",,"The article presents a study analyzing medical consultations performed on migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers aboard rescue vessels operated by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in the central Mediterranean Sea.

1. **Historical/Political Context**: Since 2014, many migrants have attempted to cross the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe, often fleeing conflict, violence, and poor conditions in their home countries. Libya’s instability has facilitated smuggling networks, leading many to attempt the dangerous sea crossing from Libya to Italy.

2. **Purpose and Challenges**: The study aims to systematically describe the health conditions (morbidities) among people crossing the Mediterranean, addressing challenges like limited diagnostic and treatment capabilities on rescue vessels.

3. **Research Methods**: The study involves a retrospective analysis of routine medical data collected by MSF from 2016 to 2019 on their rescue vessels Aquarius and Ocean Viking, focusing on outpatient consultations.

4. **Main Findings**: MSF provided 12,438 medical consultations during this period. Common conditions included skin diseases (such as scabies), motion sickness, and headaches, frequently linked to the harsh journey conditions. Cases of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) were documented, primarily among women, though possibly underestimated for men. Some severe health issues like dehydration and hypothermia were noted.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The study highlights the fluctuating conditions in the Mediterranean and restrictions faced by NGOs in conducting search and rescue operations, partly due to the involvement of the Libyan Coast Guard.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that although many diagnosed conditions were non-severe and journey-related, there were significant cases of violence and health needs that required urgent care. The study calls for better access to essential services and safety for these individuals on land.

7. **Study Limitations**: The study’s limitations include incomplete data due to the rapid need to record information, limited diagnostic capabilities on ships, and potential underestimation of conditions like mental health issues and SGBV due to space and time constraints. The political climate and operational restrictions also affected data collection.

Overall, this study sheds light on the health challenges faced by migrants attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean and the capacity issues faced by rescue organizations like MSF in addressing these needs.","ObjectivesThis study will contribute to the systematic epidemiological description of morbidities among migrants, refugees and asylum seekers when crossing the Mediterranean Sea.SettingSince 2015, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) has conducted search and rescue activities on the Mediterranean Sea to save lives, provide medical services, to witness and to speak out.ParticipantsBetween November 2016 and December 2019, MSF rescued 22 966 migrants, refugees and asylum seekers.Primary and secondary outcome measuresWe conducted retrospective data analysis of data collected between January 2016 and December 2019 as part of routine monitoring of the MSF’s healthcare services for migrants, refugees and asylum seekers on two search and rescue vessels.ResultsMSF conducted 12 438 outpatient consultations and 853 sexual and reproductive health consultations (24.9% of female population, 853/3420) and documented 287 consultations for sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). The most frequently diagnosed health conditions among children aged 5 years or older and adults were skin conditions (30.6%, 5475/17 869), motion sickness (28.6%, 5116/17 869), headache (15.4%, 2 748/17 869) and acute injuries (5.7%, 1013/17 869). Of acute injuries, 44.7% were non-violence-related injuries (453/1013), 30.1% were fuel burns (297/1013) and 25.4% were violence-related injuries (257/1013).ConclusionThe limited testing and diagnostics capacity of the outpatient department, space limitations, stigma and the generally short length of stay of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers on the ships have likely led to an underestimation of morbidities, including mental health conditions and SGBV. The main diagnoses on board were directly related to journey on land and sea and stay in Libya. We conclude that this population may be relatively young and healthy but displays significant journey-related illnesses and includes migrants, refugees and asylum seekers who have suffered significant violence during their transit and need urgent access to essential services and protection in a place of safety on land."
Dual Burden of Malnutrition Among Adolescents With Hunger Aged 12–15 Years in 41 Countries: Findings From the Global School-Based Student Health Survey,"Huaqing Liu, Min Zhang, Peipei Fu, Yan Chen, Chengchao Zhou",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.771313,2022-1-10,"['Shandong University', 'Bengbu Medical College']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Nutrition', 'Food Security']",,"The article discusses a study focusing on the dual burden of underweight and obesity among adolescents aged 12–15 experiencing hunger in different regions globally. Here's a comprehensive summary based on the requested points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: Global hunger has been a persistent issue, with projections that over 840 million people will experience hunger by 2030. Adolescents are especially vulnerable, with nearly 30% facing moderate or severe hunger. This malnutrition issue significantly impacts public health and socio-economic development.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The research aims to understand the dual burden of underweight and obesity among adolescents experiencing hunger. It addresses the paradox of hunger-related malnutrition manifesting as both underweight and obesity, challenging efforts to ensure the human right to adequate nutrition and health.

3. **Research Methods Used**: Data were sourced from the Global school-based Student Health Survey (GSHS), encompassing 26,986 adolescents with hunger from 41 countries across five regions (2010-2015). Methods included calculating the prevalence of underweight, overweight, and obesity, using WHO growth reference values, and analyzing by region, income level, gender, and age.

4. **Main Findings**: The study found a global prevalence of 6.2% underweight, 25.1% overweight, and 8.9% obesity among hungry adolescents. Southeast Asia had the highest underweight prevalence, while obesity was most prevalent in America and high-income nations. The coexistence of underweight and overweight was notably high in the Eastern Mediterranean and affluent countries.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The research underscores the need for region-specific interventions and policies to address malnutrition, hinting at policy implications for enhancing food security and regulating food industry practices to ensure access to nutritious foods.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that adolescents with hunger face varying malnutrition challenges by region, necessitating integrative policies to tackle underweight and obesity simultaneously. Recommendations include targeted food policies and interventions addressing both dimensions of malnutrition.

7. **Limitations**: Limitations involve self-reported data on weight and height, potentially underestimating overweight/obesity cases. Furthermore, varying survey timelines (2010-2015) limit data comparability across countries. The sensitive and politically influenced nature of hunger and health data may have constrained the study.

The study highlights the intricate public health challenge of addressing divergent nutritional issues among adolescents worldwide, calling for nuanced, region-specific policy action.","Background: Hunger is a pandemic among adolescents, resulting in both underweight and obesity, and posing a substantial health challenge.Objective: To estimate the dual burden of malnutrition among adolescents with hunger.Design: Data were from the Global school-based Student Health Survey (GSHS). In total, data from 26,986 adolescents with hunger across 5 regions and 41 countries between 2010 and 2015 were analyzed in this study. Weighted prevalence and mean estimates of underweight, overweight, and obesity were calculated by gender, age, and country. Prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for regional and country-level income.Results: The total prevalence of underweight, overweight and obesity among young adolescents with hunger was 6.2% (95% CI: 4.4–8.0%), 25.1% (95% CI: 20.3–29.9%) and 8.9% (95% CI: 6.5–11.3%), respectively. Southeast Asia had the highest prevalence of underweight (17.2%; 95% CI: 7.3–27.0%). America had the highest regional prevalence of obesity (11.1%; 95% CI: 7.2–15.1%) and overweight (28.9%; 95% CI: 21.9–35.9%). Low income countries had relatively high prevalence of underweight (11.5%; 95% CI: 3.2–19.9%). High income countries had the highest prevalence of obesity (17.4%; 95% CI: 14.9–19.9%) and overweight (38.7%; 95% CI: 32.0–45.4%). The co-existence of underweight and overweight among adolescents with hunger was highest in the Eastern Mediterranean region, and in upper-middle and high-income countries.Conclusions: There is a dual burden of underweight and obesity among adolescents with hunger aged 12–15 years, which differs between geographical regions. The integration of targeted interventions and policies is required to simultaneously address both underweight and increasing rates of obesity among adolescents with hunger in different regions."
Drug resistant tuberculosis in Afghanistan: We must continue to put people at the centre of treatment,Anita Mesic,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.o46,2022-1-10,[],Note,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Disease Prevention', 'Nutrition', 'Food Security', 'Migration']",,"**Summary of Article:**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Afghanistan has long faced national insecurity, contributing to limited healthcare access, particularly for diseases affecting the poor, such as tuberculosis (TB) and drug-resistant TB (DR-TB). Recent political changes, including a change of power, have led to a withdrawal of international aid from key funders, further exacerbating the healthcare crisis.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The article addresses the challenges and improvements in TB care in Afghanistan, particularly for DR-TB, and the impact of the changing political climate on these advancements. It focuses on human rights issues such as accessibility and quality of healthcare for vulnerable populations, including women and children.

3. **Research Methods:**
   Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) implemented new treatment regimens for DR-TB in Kandahar, introducing a nine-month oral regimen that allowed patients to receive treatment at home. The approach included individualized support to improve retention in care.

4. **Main Findings:**
   MSF’s changes to DR-TB treatment in Kandahar have succeeded in reducing patient dropouts and improving treatment experiences, particularly for those unable to travel for extended periods. However, recent political turmoil has led to a withdrawal of international aid, resulting in a healthcare crisis and hindering progress.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   The article briefly discusses the Afghan Ministry of Public Health’s success in decentralizing care for uncomplicated TB forms but highlights limited progress for DR-TB due to systemic challenges and now-compounded by decreased external funding.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that while TB care has improved, the combination of political instability and withdrawal of aid could reverse these gains. They emphasize the urgent need for alternative methods to deliver humanitarian assistance to maintain healthcare services, highlighting the interconnectedness of TB care with broader socioeconomic needs.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The study's limitations primarily stem from the political climate, as uncertainty and reduced international support pose challenges to sustaining healthcare improvements. Additionally, the deteriorating socioeconomic conditions in Afghanistan complicate patients' ability to adhere to treatment, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to health and humanitarian aid.",No abstract available

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The article discusses the status of Afghan women in the context of Afghanistan's turbulent history, marked by invasions, wars, and terrorism over the past four decades. A significant shift occurred on August 15, 2021, when the Taliban took control of Kabul, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government. The takeover prompted assurances from the Taliban regarding women's rights, albeit within the constraints of Shari’a Law. This context is crucial for understanding the challenges faced by Afghan women.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research examines the legal rights and security concerns of Afghan women under the Taliban regime, one year after their return to power. It seeks to address the human rights challenges faced by women in Afghanistan, particularly focusing on the gap between promises made by the Taliban and the actual status of women's rights.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study uses an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating gender studies, discourses on masculinity and femininity, and analyses of select literary texts by Khaled Hosseini and Atiq Rahimi. It draws on reports from UN Women on gender issues published in December 2021 and August 2022 to compare fictional representations with real-life scenarios in Afghanistan.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The findings highlight a significant discrepancy between the Taliban's public assurances and the harsh realities faced by Afghan women. The research identifies violations of women's rights and examines trends of increasing insecurity and restricted freedoms for women under the Taliban rule.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies:**
   The study reviews Afghanistan's legal frameworks and policies concerning women's rights in the context of the Taliban's interpretation of Shari’a Law. It critiques the effectiveness of existing laws and institutions in safeguarding women's rights under the Taliban regime.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that Afghan women's rights are severely compromised under the current regime. They recommend sustained international pressure and the implementation of more robust legal protections to ensure the rights and security of Afghan women. Greater emphasis on women’s security and empowerment is advocated.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The study acknowledges limitations related to Afghanistan's volatile political climate and the restricted availability of reliable data. The sensitive nature of human rights topics in Afghanistan presents further challenges in gathering accurate information and conducting comprehensive analyses.","The status of Afghan women has been a subject of academic interest primarily because of the strict patriarchal hegemony that they have been subjected to. Afghanistan has seen enormous changes in the last four decades due to multiple invasions, wars, and terrorism. 15th August 2021 marks a significant transition in the Afghan socio-political scenario with the Afghan government collapsing as Taliban took over Kabul. The Taliban’s initial public statements after seizing power included assurances on allowing women their rights within the framework of Shari’a Law. Against this backdrop, this paper examines the actual status of Afghan women’s legal rights and security concerns at present after the completion of one year of the Taliban take-over. The study delves into an exploration of the changing dynamics of women’s status in real-life vis-à-vis such portrayals in select literary texts by Khaled Hosseini and Atiq Rahimi to understand how their narrative spaces mirror the socio-political conflicts in Afghanistan. Drawing upon Gender Studies and discourses concerning masculinity and femininity, particularly studies conducted on women and violence, and the UN Women’s reports on gender alert published in December 2021 and August 2022, this paper aims to explore the fictional space in relation to the real-life scenario in Afghanistan."
Maternal health literacy and pregnancy outcomes in Afghanistan,"AbbasAli Husseini, Mehran Rostamzadeh, Zainab Ezadi, Maryam Hosseini",https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_746_22,,['İstanbul Gelişim Üniversitesi'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Education']","['Maternal Health', 'Gender']",,"**Summary of the Article on Maternal Health Literacy in Afghanistan**

1. **Context**: Afghanistan is grappling with some of the poorest health indicators in the world, particularly concerning maternal and child health. The country's maternal mortality rate is exceedingly high, and the Taliban's return to power has exacerbated these conditions. Given a predominantly illiterate female population (75.8%), the role of health literacy (HL) becomes critical, especially in maternal health literacy (MHL), which is essential for safe pregnancies and childbirth.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The study aims to explore if inadequate MHL correlates significantly with poor pregnancy outcomes (PO) in Afghanistan. It investigates the potential links between demographic variables and MHL, as well as PO.

3. **Research Methods**: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Dasht-e-Barchi Hospital in Kabul, involving 200 women aged 15 and older who attended the hospital for prenatal care. Data were collected using a modified questionnaire to assess MHL and PO, followed by statistical analysis to determine correlations and significance.

4. **Main Findings**: The study revealed inadequate HL among Afghan women, with a mean MHL score of 37.1 and mean PO score of 33.1. Significant correlations were found between MHL and variables such as age, education level, and prenatal care timing. Importantly, a positive correlation exists between MHL and PO, highlighting that low MHL adversely affects pregnancy outcomes.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The study does not delve deeply into Afghanistan's legal frameworks or policies. However, it acknowledges the dire social and economic conditions impeding institutional support for health literacy advancements.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The study concludes that inadequate MHL severely impacts prenatal care quality and PO in Afghanistan. It advocates for research into MHL's psychological impacts and urges addressing limitations in data collection due to security concerns. Policymakers should focus on improving education, socioeconomic conditions, and healthcare access in Afghanistan.

7. **Limitations**: Key limitations include the focus on urban populations (potential lack of representativeness for rural women), security constraints on data collection, and the questionnaire's restrictions on measuring the practical application of health knowledge. These factors may affect the study's conclusions about the broader Afghan context.

               In 2010, as the Afghan government announced its intention to begin a formal peace process, there were numerous calls for women to have a seat at the table. Both mainstream and critical discourse on women and the peace process in Afghanistan, however, relied on the production of essentialized subjectivities which failed to recognize the political and social complexity of women's lives, diminished their intellectual contributions and silenced their voices. This article challenges the simultaneous hyper-visualization and silencing of Afghan women by both Afghan and international actors. Drawing on feminist and decolonial theory, we examine the ways in which the colonial mechanisms of intervention, patriarchy and the global hierarchies of knowledge production worked in tandem to marginalize Afghan women while upholding them as agents of peace. The article brings together findings from three participatory research projects on women and peace, which took place from 2010 to 2014 across eight provinces in Afghanistan. A prismed view of the participants' intersectional realities is constructed, which highlights diverse positionalities and articulations of peace, the social and political cleavages, and differentiated obstacles to their involvement in the peace and reintegration process. The concluding remarks emphasize the relevance of these findings for Afghanistan at the time of publication."

Here is a summary addressing the required points:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Afghanistan has faced significant challenges due to ongoing conflict and instability, affecting its healthcare infrastructure. Access to healthcare, especially for chronic diseases like cancer, is limited, compounded by economic hardships that most Afghans face.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The study aims to quantify the economic burden of cancer treatment on both the public healthcare system and patients. It addresses the human rights challenge of adequate healthcare access and the financial strain placed on patients requiring cancer treatment.

3. **Research Methods:**
   This cross-sectional study analyzed medical records of 769 patients from Jamhuriyat Hospital in Kabul for the year 2020. Costs were determined based on average prices from three private hospitals and converted to U.S. dollars. Data was processed using Microsoft Excel.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The study found breast cancer to be the most prevalent and costly among the five types analyzed, followed by esophagus, colorectal, stomach, and lung cancers. The total cost of treatment was approximately $590,662.98, with patients paying $82,537 out-of-pocket. These costs represent a substantial financial burden on patients.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   While the study highlights the need for governmental intervention and increased healthcare facilities, it does not delve into an examination of existing legal frameworks or policies in Afghanistan related to healthcare or human rights.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that cancer treatment costs are high and emphasize the need for the Afghan government to enhance healthcare service provision. They recommend increased government support and international aid to improve access and alleviate patients' financial burdens.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The study is limited by the availability of data, focusing on only one hospital over a single year. Furthermore, Afghanistan's unstable political climate and underdeveloped healthcare infrastructure likely influenced findings, highlighting the challenges in addressing healthcare needs comprehensively.",No abstract available

Assessing the preliminary outcomes of nearly a quarter-century of the US military and their NATO allies’ presence in Afghanistan, U.S. President Joseph Biden announced the end of “an era of major military operations to remake other countries”. Though the consequences of the Western coalition campaign in the area remain to be evaluated and they are unlikely to turn out to be unequivocal, the Atlantic strategy aimed at rebuilding and democratization of Afghanistan proved itself as bankrupt. Our research focuses on the way the twenty-year military campaign in Afghanistan affected the development of the U.S. private military and security companies (PMSC) industry. For these purposes, we, firstly, studied and traced the transformation of the private military and security services market in the U.S., and examined the changes of approaches and mechanisms used to contract PMSCs. Secondly, we analyzed the way the U.S. authorities addressed the challenges new market evoked, focusing on the measures of legal regulation that were applied to PMSCs, and the way the working of the U.S. institutional mechanisms was transforming. The final part of the research contains conclusions on the perspectives for the development of the American PMSC industry after the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from Afghanistan. We believe that due to its duration and continuity, the Afghan operation ensured a launchpad for the PMSC industry and provided conditions for private military and security companies to acquire and master high-end experience which in turn, contributed to the development of a certain market that goes well beyond the involvement of conventional human capital. It provided solutions for the production, utilization, and maintenance of the equipment and technologies, allowing the minimization of the direct participation of specialists in hostilities. Alongside the development of the American PMSC industry itself, the research studies the investigations conducted by the U.S. authorities into the cases of abuse committed by the contractors during their participation in Afghan war. It discusses the way this practice encouraged the transformations of United States procedures and mechanisms aimed at reducing malpractice when performing contracts and launched changes in U.S. legislation. It also demonstrates the lessons learned by the U.S. from the contractual practice with regard to the regulation of PMSCs. The research reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the American policy regarding PMSCs during the whole period of the military conflict in Afghanistan and helps to evaluate the success of the U.S. efforts in monitoring contractors across Afghanistan. To conclude, we reckon that considerable contractual experience acquired in Afghanistan ensures technological and procedural progress of the U.S. PMSC industry. Given the enduring rivalry between the U.S., Russia, and China, including in the military and technological spheres, the twenty-year experience of direct participation in hostilities by U.S. PMSCs boosted its competitive advantage compared to Russia and China, whose PMSCs still lack such an experience."
Women’s Peacebuilding Roles in Afghanistan: Potent Approaches for Social Transformation,"Mari Katayanagi, Sohilla Khan",https://doi.org/10.14431/aw.2022.9.38.3.77,,['Hiroshima University'],Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Governance']","['Gender', 'Peace Initiatives']",,"The article examines the role of Afghan women in peacebuilding activities, especially before the return of the Taliban. It focuses on assessing these roles through the lens of social transformation, highlighting how women's involvement has historically shifted with changing political contexts.

1. **Historical Context**: Afghan women's societal participation evolved over time, with significant advancements toward the end of the 19th century and during the 20th century. However, progress was frequently reversed due to political upheavals, such as the rise of the mujahideen and the Taliban. Women's rights were again severely restricted after the Taliban's takeover of Kabul on August 15, 2021. Although Afghanistan's laws, such as Article 22 of the Constitution, theoretically protect women's rights, in reality, these rights are often not realized due to cultural and political barriers.

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The study aims to explore women's roles in Afghanistan's peacebuilding process, seeking to understand their potential for social transformation and the impact of their engagement on societal power relations. It specifically investigates obstacles and opportunities for Afghan women's participation in peacebuilding.

3. **Research Methods**: The research combines desk reviews with a questionnaire survey conducted with ten individuals involved in peacebuilding. It involves open-ended questions aimed at understanding perceptions and suggestions for enhancing women's roles in peacebuilding.

4. **Main Findings**: The study found that while women’s participation in peacebuilding was generally supported, they faced significant cultural and security challenges. Despite legislative progress, women’s substantial involvement remained limited, especially in light of the prevalent patriarchal attitudes and lack of political support.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The article discusses the Afghan legal system, which formally includes rights and equality for women, and various initiatives like the National Action Plan for Women of Afghanistan. However, practical implementation and adherence to these frameworks fall short.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that women's roles in peacebuilding must be viewed as part of transformative social processes. They recommend a multifaceted approach that goes beyond nominal representation to include substantial empowerment and actual participation in decision-making processes. Women's roles should be increased both in political and home environments as peace advocates.

7. **Limitations**: The study notes its limited sample size and the difficulties of generalizing the findings. It also addresses constraints due to the sensitive political climate and the lack of secure environments for women, which impedes broader political participation and data collection.

Overall, the study underscores the importance of women's participation in peacebuilding to achieve sustainable social transformation, despite the significant barriers they face in contemporary Afghanistan under Taliban rule.",No abstract available

The data were obtained from the latest wave of the Demographic and Health Survey in Afghanistan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan. Binary logistic regression analyses show mixed results, with a significant association between at least one type of IPV and unmet need for FP in all countries under study, except Maldives. There were also contrasting findings on the IPV–unmet need nexus, with a positive sign in some but negative sign in others. Women who experienced physical violence were associated with a higher odds of having an unmet need in Pakistan, but the opposite was true in Afghanistan and Nepal. The odds of having an unmet need were higher among Indian women who experienced IPV (sexual and emotional). In Afghanistan, women who experienced IPV (physical and emotional) have lower odds of having an unmet need. However, the interaction analysis of IPV (physical and sexual) and partners’ controlling behavior showed a positive association with unmet need. Policymakers need to develop policies and strategies to prevent IPV and reduce unmet need for FP, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. "

Hence, to avoid the spread of virus in public settings. In addition, the study has provided compelling data and evidence on the coronavirus disease-2019 trend for health policymakers to make strategic decisions. Introduction: The coronavirus disease-2019 is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2. The disease has spread across the globe. In Afghanistan, thousands of confirmed cases with hundreds of deaths have been reported. In addition, due to insufficient healthcare workforce, insecurity, fragile healthcare infrastructure, low coronavirus disease-2019 vaccination and low testing capacity, the true nature of the pandemic is unlcear. Method: An online survey of the general population in Afghanistan was conducted from April-May 2021. Convenience sampling technique was used to recruit the respondents. Social media platforms were used (WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook Messenger) to disseminate the electronic survey instrument. Written informed consent was taken from the participants before the filling questionnaires. Data collection was guided through a self-administered questionnaire developed by the researchers according to the World Health Organization guidelines. The sample size was calculated using EPI software. The inclusion criteria were being 18 years or older and having access to the Internet to fill out the online questionnaire. IBM SPSS Statistics version 25.0 was used for analysis. Descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages) and bi-variable (chi-square) analyses were done. A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant at a 95% confidence interval. Results: From 1094 respondents, 78% were male. The majority of respondents were aged ⩽30 years and had an undergraduate education. Nearly 1 in 3 participants were healthcare workers, and 70% lived in households with five or more family members. Overall, 70% of the respondents reported good preventive practices. The majority of the participants reported covering their mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing and cleaning their hands regularly and using alcohol. Meanwhile, 80% of the participants wore a mask when going outside. Moreover, people with post-graduate education had a higher level of preventive practices than those with an undergraduate education. The results of logistic regression revealed participants residence in Kabul, healthcare workers, family size less than 5, avoid meeting people outside, gender, and avoiding 3Cs, were the significant determinants of adhering to good preventive practices. Conclusion: Generally, the public in Afghanistan followed infection prevention rules. However, certain areas require further improvement, such as observing social distance and avoiding shaking hands when meeting others. Negligence of these prevention practices can lead to an increase in infection transmission among people. Public awareness should be continued to keep the people supportive of the government policies.

The Feminist War and Its Victims,Torunn Wimpelmann,https://doi.org/10.23865/intpol.v80.3947,2022-8-17,['Chr. Michelsen Institute'],Article,1,Yes,"['Human Rights', 'Security and Conflict']","['Peace Initiatives', 'Gender', 'Gender Apartheid']",,"1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The article examines the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, which was partially justified by Western powers as a mission to save Afghan women. This framing was used as part of the narrative to gain support for the intervention. However, the complexity of Afghan women's rights issues and their progress over time has often been overshadowed by this initial justification.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research seeks to investigate the portrayal of the Afghan war as a ""feminist"" intervention and how this has influenced perceptions of the actual progress in women's rights in Afghanistan. It addresses the human rights challenge of how the progress made can be dismissed or sidelined in political negotiations, such as peace agreements with the Taliban, where women's rights may be compromised for broader political goals.

3. **Research Methods**: The article does not detail specific research methods, but it suggests a critical analysis of historical and current narratives surrounding Afghan women's rights and the political use of these narratives in peace processes.

4. **Main Findings**: The main findings highlight that significant progress in Afghan women's rights since 2001 has often been minimized or set aside during talks of peace agreements with the Taliban. After the Taliban's return to power in 2021, a new conflict emerged between addressing the humanitarian crisis and upholding women's rights, as the two were portrayed as mutually exclusive choices.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The article implies criticism of political decision-making processes that neglect the established progress in women's rights, though it does not specifically examine legal frameworks or institutions in Afghanistan.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that the framing of the war as a feminist mission has been problematic and has led to the devaluation of actual progress in Afghan women's rights. They recommend reconsidering the prioritization of rights in political processes and warn against allowing political negotiations to overlook these gains.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study reflects on the challenges due to the political climate, particularly the sensitivity of advocating for women's rights in the context of Afghanistan's complex geopolitical situation. It also touches on the difficulty of sustaining commitment to human rights improvements amidst a humanitarian crisis, suggesting that these political dynamics can limit comprehensive analysis and advocacy for Afghan women's rights.","Invasjonen av Afghanistan i 2001 ble delvis rettferdiggjort som en krig for å redde afghanske kvinner. Artikkelen viser hvordan denne – dypt problematiske – «feministiske» innrammingen av krigen på mange måter har overskygget for det som har funnet sted av betydelige fremskritt når det gjelder kvinners situasjon i perioden etter 2001. Videre utforsker jeg hvordan disse fremskrittene ble underkjent som så utbetydelige at de uten større konsekvenser kunne settes til side i en mulig fredsavtale med Taliban. Dermed ble afghanske kvinneaktivister som ønsket å fremme krav om kvinners rettigheter i en eventuell fredsprossess anklaget for å sette sine egne elitistiske behov foran muligheten til å få slutt på krigen. Et liknende motsetningsforhold har oppstått etter at Taliban tok makten i august 2021, i form av et konstruert valg mellom befolkningens mulighet til å overleve den humanitære krisen i kjølvannet av Talibans maktovertakelse på den ene siden, og å insistere på prinsippene knyttet til kvinners rettigheter på den andre.
Abstract in EnglishThe Feminist War and Its VictimsThe 2001 invasion of Afghanistan was partially justified as a war to liberate the country’s women. This article shows how the – deeply problematic – ‘feminist’ framing of the war in many ways eclipsed the significant progress that has taken place in regards to Afghan women’s rights since 2001. Furthermore, I explore how such progress came to be denoted as so insignificant as to be easily cast aside in a prospective peace agreement with the Taliban. Afghan women activists who sought to advance women’s rights in a potential peace process were accused of prioritizing their own elitist interests above the possibility of ending the war. A similar dichotomy has emerged after the Taliban’s seizure of power in 2021, in the shape of a posited choice between the population’s ability to survive the humanitarian crisis developing in the aftermath of Taliban’s takeover on the one hand, and insisting on principles of women’s rights on the other."
The Road Ahead - Confrontation or Creative Compromises?,"Astri Suhrke, Arne Strand",https://doi.org/10.23865/intpol.v80.3904,2022-8-17,['Chr. Michelsen Institute'],Article,1,Yes,"['Governance', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['International Community', 'Policy Reform', 'Migration', 'Food Security']",,"**Summary:**

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   - The Western response to the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021 mirrors the strategy implemented when the Taliban first seized power in 1996. During the previous Taliban regime, Western states and the United Nations sought to isolate Afghanistan by refusing diplomatic recognition, imposing strict sanctions, and restricting cooperation with Taliban authorities.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   - The research examines whether a similar approach of sanctions and isolation today will yield effective results in addressing human rights issues in Afghanistan. It questions the efficacy of past strategies and explores the potential for more balanced and strategic engagement.

3. **Research Methods:**
   - The article appears to use a historical and analytical approach, reviewing the outcomes of past policies and considering their relevance in the present context. It likely involves a comparative analysis of past and present Western policies towards the Taliban regime.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - The historical sanctions and isolation policies of the 1990s did not achieve their intended outcomes and were largely counter-productive. The study suggests that there may be little reason to expect similar strategies to be more successful today.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   - The article does not provide a detailed examination of Afghanistan's legal frameworks. Instead, it focuses on international strategies, particularly those of Western countries and the UN, towards engaging with the Taliban regime.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - The authors conclude that a sanctions-and-isolation strategy might not be effective. They propose considering a broader, more balanced approach to engaging with the Taliban, which could potentially lead to more constructive outcomes.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   - The study might be limited by the sensitive and evolving political climate in Afghanistan, which affects data availability and the capacity to directly assess human rights conditions. The historical and comparative analysis might not fully capture current complexities and dynamics.","Vestens umiddelbare reaksjon på Talibans maktovertakelse i Afghanistan i august 2021 har stort sett vært den samme som da Taliban kom til makten første gang i 1996. Vestlige stater og FN valgte den gang å isolere regimet, nekte diplomatisk anerkjennelse og etter hvert innføre strenge sanksjoner. Humanitær bistand var tillatt, men ikke samarbeid med Talibans statlige organer og ikke kanalisering av bistand via staten. Det er derfor grunn til å vurdere Vestens nåværende respons i lys av historien. Sanksjons- og isoleringspolitikken på 1990-tallet ga ikke forventede resultater og virket for det meste mot sin hensikt. Er det grunn til å tro at en lignende politikk i dag vil være mer effektiv? Hvis ikke, hva er konturene av et bredere og strategisk mer balansert engasjement?
Abstract in EnglishThe Road Ahead – Confrontation or Creative Compromises?The immediate reaction of Western states to the Taliban’s seizure of power in Afghanistan in August 2021 was broadly speaking the same as when the Taliban first came to power in 1996. Western states and the UN chose at that time to isolate the regime, deny it diplomatic recognition and gradually impose strong sanctions. Humanitarian assistance was allowed, but not program cooperation with Taliban authorities and state institutions, and no assistance was to be channelled via the Taliban-controlled state. The results are highly relevant today. In the 1990s, the sanctions-and-isolation policy did not bring about the desired results, and in important respects were counter-productive. Are there reasons to believe that similar policies today will be more effective? This article outlines the contours of a broader and strategic more balanced engagement."

1. **Historical and Social Context**: The World Health Organization's Western Pacific Region (WPR) has been free of polio for over two decades. Globally, polio cases due to the wild type 1 poliovirus are rare, confined to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Malawi in 2021. However, within the WPR, there is a concern over outbreaks related to circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs), especially as their occurrence has increased since the late 2010s.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The article aims to address the ongoing challenges posed by cVDPVs in the WPR, even amidst declining global cases of wild poliovirus. It focuses on understanding polio outbreak risks and aims to update immunization and surveillance strategies to prevent cVDPV-related outbreaks.

3. **Research Methods**: While the article does not provide a detailed methodology, it reviews recent cVDPV outbreaks in the WPR, examining the frequency, magnitude, and geographic distribution of these outbreaks.

4. **Main Findings**: The research highlights an increase in the frequency and scale of cVDPV outbreaks in the WPR, with significant events occurring in the Philippines and Malaysia during 2019–2020. These outbreaks underscore the persistent risk, particularly in high-risk areas or communities.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks**: The article does not explicitly focus on national legal frameworks or policies in relation to human rights; instead, it emphasizes the need for effective immunization and surveillance strategies.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that despite historical success in maintaining a polio-free status, the threat from cVDPVs remains significant. They advocate for revised and reinforced polio immunization and surveillance policies to preempt future outbreaks.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The article suggests that while historical cVDPV outbreaks have been controlled effectively, future risks require ongoing vigilance. Limitations include the absence of a detailed analysis of country-specific political climates or data availability, as well as potential challenges in addressing sensitive public health communications related to vaccine administration.",No abstract available

To offer a comprehensive summary based on the information and points you requested, I'll assume these references collectively reflect a significant body of research on PPR. Here's a hypothetical summary of such an article:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a highly contagious viral disease affecting small ruminants like sheep and goats. It is particularly prevalent in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, where small ruminants are critical to the livelihoods of rural communities. Historically, efforts by organizations such as the FAO and OIE have aimed to control and eradicate the disease due to its economic and social impact on farming communities in these regions.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The collective research aims to support PPRV eradication by understanding its spread, impact, and control measures. It addresses human rights concerns related to food security, economic loss, and rural livelihoods, which are threatened by PPR outbreaks.

3. **Research Methods Used:**
   The research methods across these studies include serological surveys, molecular diagnostics, and outbreak analyses. Some studies involved isolating and characterizing the virus, while others focused on epidemiological modeling and cost-benefit analysis of eradication efforts.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The research identifies several trends, including the widespread prevalence of PPR in endemic regions and evidence of cross-border spread. Major findings include the identification of specific outbreaks, genetic characterization of virus strains, and the economic impact on affected regions. Human rights violations include threats to food security and economic stability due to livestock loss.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   Some studies examine national and international policies, such as vaccination campaigns and disease management strategies. Organizations like FAO and OIE promote a global strategy for PPR control, emphasizing cooperation among countries to foster eradication goals.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that complete eradication of PPR is feasible with sustained international cooperation and investment in vaccination programs. They recommend strengthening veterinary services, enhancing disease surveillance, and ensuring community engagement in control measures.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The studies face limitations including incomplete data from remote areas, political instability that hinders research and control efforts, and the sensitivity of engaging with communities reliant on small ruminants. The variability in national response capacities also poses challenges to implementing uniform control measures.

This summary provides an overview based on the listed references, focusing on the impact and control strategies related to the PPR virus across different regions.","Abstract: Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) notifiable, economically important transboundary, highly contagious, and an acute viral disease of small ruminants. The disease is caused by the PPR virus (PPRV). PPRV belongs to the genus Morbillivirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. The recent epidemiological and molecular characterization of PPR virus isolates subdivides them into four genetically distinct lineages (I, II, III and IV). The disease is endemic across Asia, the Middle East and African regions and is considered a major obstacle to the development of sustainable agriculture across the developing world due to its huge burden on the economy and development of the affected countries and has recently been targeted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the OIE for global eradication by 2030. PPR-endemic countries should join the regional force, and implement regional road maps for the progressive and successful control and elimination of PPRV. In this review, the regional epidemiology of PPR outbreaks and associated risk factors, including animal factors (age, species and sex), environmental factors (season, spatial distribution of disease in various locations) and trade associated factors with special reference to the PPR affected countries in South, Central and East Asia are comprehensively discussed.Key words: epidemiology; PPR-virus; risk factors; control; eradication; AsiaREGIONALNA EPIDEMIOLOGIJA IN Z NJO POVEZANI DEJAVNIKI TVEGANJA ZA KUGO DROBNICE V AZIJI – PREGLEDIzvleček: Kuga drobnice (angl., Peste des petits ruminants, PPR) je gospodarsko pomembna, čezmejno nevarna, visoko nalezljiva, akutna virusna bolezen drobnice, ki jo je potrebno prijaviti Svetovni organizaciji za zdravje živali (OIE).

CHINA’S CONTRIBUTION TO THE STABILIZATION OF ‘DEMOCRATIC’ AFGHANISTAN,Łukasz Jureńczyk,https://doi.org/10.22456/2238-6912.121733,2022-8-15,['Kazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz'],Article,1,Yes,"['Security and Conflict', 'Economy and Infrastructure']","['Peace Initiatives', 'Economic Growth']",,"The article discusses China's role in stabilizing Afghanistan's security during its democratic transition. Here's a summary based on the points provided:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context**: The article situates itself in the context of Afghanistan's democratic transition and the broader geopolitical dynamics involving the US and China's foreign policy. Historically, Afghanistan has been a contentious area with foreign involvement from major powers, including the US, post-9/11. China, wary of antagonizing extremist groups and not wanting to bolster US presence, approached Afghanistan with caution, maintaining a focus primarily on economic interests.

2. **Purpose of the Research**: The research aims to evaluate China's involvement in Afghanistan, specifically focusing on human rights implications related to stability and security efforts. It examines the balancing act China performed in trying to promote stability without direct military involvement or political support for existing regimes.

3. **Research Methods**: The authors appear to have conducted a qualitative analysis of China's diplomatic, economic, and foreign policy initiatives concerning Afghanistan. This likely involves reviewing official documents, policy papers, and possibly interviews or secondary analyses of economic and political developments.

4. **Main Findings**: The research finds that China's involvement was markedly limited in scope concerning direct security aid or political stabilization efforts. Instead, China sought to leverage economic investments and trade as tools to indirectly foster stability and, by extension, improve human security and rights conditions. However, this indirect approach had limited immediate effect on enhancing political stability.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The article may discuss how Chinese policies align with its broader non-interventionist stance and its strategic focus on economic investment, contrasting them with the Western approach of political and military engagement.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors likely conclude that while China's economic strategies potentially benefit Afghanistan's stability long-term, a more direct engagement with human rights issues and security frameworks might be necessary for immediate improvements. They might recommend a more integrated approach that combines economic investments with initiatives directly addressing security and human rights challenges.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: Potential limitations include the restricted availability of data from Chinese and Afghan sources, the challenging nature of objectively assessing the impact of economic policies on human rights, and the political sensitivity of China's role in a region heavily influenced by geopolitical tensions. Additionally, the authors might note that China's cautious stance limits the breadth of direct human rights impacts observable from its policies.

This summary reflects the abstract's implications and broad themes, touching upon geopolitical strategy, economic engagement, and the indirect nature of China's involvement in Afghanistan's transition.","The purpose of the paper is to present and evaluate the involvement of the People's Republic of China in stabilizing the security of Afghanistan during the democratic transition. China's efforts to secure Afghanistan were very limited as it did not want to support the US position in the country and antagonize extremist groupings. Its relations with Afghanistan were focused on economic issues, which resulted from its own goals and interests. China hoped that the intensified investments and trade, and thus economic growth, would positively translate into the stability and security of Afghanistan."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The article is set in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted global health systems, including routine immunization programs, leading to significant human rights concerns regarding access to healthcare. In Afghanistan, these impacts were compounded by existing vulnerabilities due to ongoing conflict and a fragile health infrastructure.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The study aimed to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine immunization (RI) in Afghanistan's Laghman province. It specifically addressed human rights issues related to healthcare access, focusing on disruptions in immunization services for children, a vulnerable population at risk of vaccine-preventable diseases.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The research involved a comparative analysis using data from the Afghanistan Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) database, reviewing immunization coverage during the April-July 2020 lockdown against the same period in 2019. Data was collected from 41 out of 45 health facilities offering RI services in Laghman province.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The study identified a 21.4% decline in overall immunization coverage, with significant reductions in specific vaccines such as measles and oral polio vaccine (OPV). Outreach services saw a 56.1% decrease in coverage, compared to a 13% decline for fixed services. The reduced access disproportionately affected girls, with a 26% decline compared to 17% for boys.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   The study references Afghanistan's healthcare policies, particularly the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) and the Essential Package of Hospital Services (EPHS), which facilitate immunization programs.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors concluded that the pandemic heightened risks of vaccine-preventable diseases due to diminished immunization outreach. They recommend strengthening health services through sustained RI, following WHO guidelines, enhancing health worker capacity, and conducting public awareness campaigns. They also urged tailored interventions during pandemics to maintain immunization access.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   Limitations included potential data availability issues and the sensitivity of conducting research in Afghanistan's politically unstable environment, marked by conflict and reduced healthcare system capacity. The study also acknowledged external factors like global vaccine supply chain disruptions impacting local immunization efforts.",No abstract available
Community health worker service delivery for maternal and child health: an observational study from Afghanistan,"Clare B Kelly, Shafiqullah Hemat, Malalai Naziri, Khaksar Yousufi, Karen M Edmond",https://doi.org/10.1136/ARCHDISCHILD-2021-322968,2021-12-16,['Faculty of Life Sciences &amp; Medicine'],Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Maternal Health', 'Food Security']",,"**Summary of the Article on the CHW Program in Afghanistan**

1. **Context:**
   - Since 2003, community health workers (CHWs) have been integral to the Ministry of Public Health's efforts to deliver basic healthcare services in Afghanistan, particularly in rural areas. The country's geography, high levels of poverty, and persistent conflict create challenges in accessing healthcare, particularly for women and children.

2. **Purpose:**
   - The study aimed to assess the availability and distribution of CHWs in remote and non-remote districts of Afghanistan. It sought to understand how geographic remoteness affects the frequency of CHW visits during antenatal (ANV) and postnatal (PNV) periods, and the provision of essential supplies and drugs.

3. **Methods:**
   - This non-randomized observational study analyzed data from September 2018 to September 2019 across 34 Afghan provinces, excluding Kabul. It utilized statistical analyses to compare CHW activities and healthcare delivery outcomes between remote and non-remote districts, using data from the national Health Management Information System (HMIS).

4. **Findings:**
   - Remote districts had more CHWs per pregnant woman (almost two CHWs per 100 women) compared to non-remote districts. Pregnant women in remote areas had higher rates of ANV and PNV visits. There were more referrals and treatments for diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections, and malnutrition among children in remote areas. However, obstetric referrals did not differ significantly between remote and non-remote areas.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   - Although not directly addressed, the study indicates the role of the Ministry of Public Health in supporting CHWs through training and supervision. The CHW program is part of a strategic effort to extend healthcare access in rural areas, aligning with broader health policy interventions.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - The study concludes that the MoPH initiative successfully increased CHW coverage in remote areas, effectively delivering ANV and PNV services. Recommendations include maintaining and enhancing the CHW network to further improve maternal and child health outcomes and ensuring consistent drug supplies to maintain community trust.

7. **Limitations:**
   - Limitations include potential biases due to reliance on HMIS, which might not capture the full population in extreme rural or conflict-affected areas. The study lacked data on economic status, wealth quintiles, gender of CHWs, and the quality of care provided. These factors are crucial for assessing the equitable distribution and effectiveness of health services.

Overall, the study highlights the significance of CHWs in improving healthcare access in rural Afghanistan and the need for continued investment in and support for these community-based health interventions.","ObjectiveTo understand the reach of the community health worker (CHW) programme in remote and non-remote districts of Afghanistan.MethodsUsing data collected from the Ministry of Public Health’s National Health Management Information System, we conducted a population-based study from 2018 to 2019 in 401 districts across 34 provinces of Afghanistan. We assessed the availability of CHWs, antenatal visits (ANV) and postnatal visits (PNV) conducted by the CHWs, and the availability of CHW supplies. Districts were classified as remote if the district centre was &gt;2 hours by any form of transport from provincial capital, and non-remote if &lt;2 hours. Data were analysed using multivariable regression models.Results15 562 CHWs were working in the districts of Afghanistan, 13 482 (87%) in remote and 2080 (13%) in non-remote districts. The mean of the proportion of CHWs per pregnant woman was higher in remote (0.019 (SD 0.011)) compared with non-remote (0.012 (SD 0.006)) districts (adjusted mean difference (AMD) 0.008, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.01). The mean of the proportion of ANVs received from a CHW per pregnant women was higher in remote (0.88 (SD 0.82)) compared with non-remote (0.62 (SD 0.50)) districts (AMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.54). The mean of the proportion of PNVs received from a CHW per pregnant women was higher in remote (0.54 (SD 0.53)) compared with non-remote (0.36 (SD 0.25)) districts (AMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.36). The mean of the proportion of CHWs who reported that they had stocks of cotrimoxazole and oral contraceptives in the previous month per district was higher in remote compared with non-remote districts.ConclusionsIn Afghanistan, the CHW programme appears to be effective and proportionate to need in remote regions."
Factors Associated with HIV Risk and Vulnerability Among Injecting Drug Users in Afghanistan: A Narrative Review,Ahmad Shekaib Rasikh,https://doi.org/10.2147/HIV.S366970,2022-7,"['Kabul University', 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam']",Review,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Human Rights']","['Disease Prevention', 'Civil Liberties']",,"This article explores the increasing public health issue of HIV among injecting drug users (IDUs) in Afghanistan, providing historical, political, and social context, and investigating the factors that contribute to the risk and vulnerability of IDUs to HIV infection.

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   - Afghanistan is the world’s largest producer of opium, contributing significantly to drug use within the country. Despite dominant drug consumption methods like smoking or ingesting, there is a growing shift towards injecting drugs. Afghanistan has faced decades of armed conflict, causing instability and large refugee movements, which have further exacerbated safety and health challenges, including the spread of HIV among displaced populations.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Challenges Addressed:**
   - The study aims to identify HIV risk factors among IDUs in Afghanistan, focusing on the social structural determinants making them vulnerable to the virus. This involves addressing health-related human rights, such as access to harm reduction services and confronting stigma and discrimination against drug users.

3. **Research Methods:**
   - The study is a narrative literature review, utilizing a comprehensive search of electronic databases and grey literature for relevant articles and surveys concerning IDU and HIV, particularly in Afghanistan. The analysis applies the modified social ecological model to assess the factors contributing to HIV risk and vulnerability among IDUs.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - High HIV risk is noted due to shared use of non-sterile injecting equipment and unprotected sexual practices among IDUs. Stigma and insufficient knowledge about HIV transmission contribute significantly to increased vulnerability. Despite the harm reduction services available, awareness and uptake remain low.

5. **Examination of the Country's Legal Frameworks:**
   - Afghanistan's government shows commitment to international HIV/AIDS accords and has established relevant programs and strategies. However, punitive drug laws, lack of anti-discrimination protection, financial dependency on external HIV response resources, and underutilization of harm reduction services highlight significant legal and policy gaps.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - The article concludes that numerous factors put Afghan IDUs at risk and exacerbate their vulnerability to HIV, including risky behaviors, socioeconomic issues, stigma, and inadequate national responses. The authors recommend a multisectoral response to effectively address this growing epidemic, emphasizing the need to expand harm reduction services as a proven best practice internationally.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   - The study suffers from a limited scope, with data available only from selected cities and inadequate nationwide research on IDUs and HIV. Political instability and resource constraints further hinder comprehensive data collection and intervention implementation. This lack of information may impede effective responses to the country's HIV crisis among IDUs.",No abstract available

1. **Historical, Political, and Social Context:**
   The COVID-19 pandemic struck Afghanistan during a period of political change and upheaval. The country's healthcare system was fragile, unable to adequately respond to the pandemic, lacking essential communication, contact tracing, and testing capabilities. This was compounded by Afghanistan's political instability, especially following the collapse of the previous government in August 2021, which led to a reduction in international funding and support for the healthcare system.

2. **Purpose of the Research and Human Rights Challenges:**
   The commentary aims to address the human rights challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in Afghanistan, particularly focusing on the health rights of its citizens during a politically unstable time. It highlights the government's inability to meet the healthcare needs of its population, especially the most vulnerable.

3. **Research Methods Used:**
   The article uses data analysis from the District Health Information Software-2 (DHIS2) to track the progression of COVID-19 cases in Afghanistan. It examines trends across the four waves of the pandemic up to March 2022, relying on reported figures and vaccine distribution data.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The study finds a significantly low COVID-19 vaccination rate, with only 10% of the population vaccinated, far below the 60% target. The healthcare system faced severe constraints due to lack of personnel, diagnostic capacity, and financial resources. This has resulted in insufficient COVID-19 response efforts and inaccurate mortality and morbidity data.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   The article discusses the limited response capacity due to underfunded healthcare infrastructures prior to and following the government collapse. It points out the need for international support and better integration of COVID-19 responses within existing healthcare services. Although not extensive, it implies inadequacies in the legal and institutional frameworks affecting health rights.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that Afghanistan requires immediate expanded international support to restore and improve its healthcare system. Long-term sustainability should involve integrating COVID-19 services into existing healthcare frameworks like the Sehatmandi project. Public awareness and vaccination campaigns need to be accelerated, particularly engaging social media and healthcare workers to improve public willingness for vaccination.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   The article highlights the limitations in data accuracy due to the unstable political climate, and the sensitivity of information related to healthcare access and human rights. The unstable government and lack of resources further compound these challenges, indicating that actual infection rates and healthcare access issues might be underreported or inaccurately depicted.

Overall, the commentary underscores the critical need for coordinated global and local efforts to address the public health and human rights challenges introduced by the pandemic in Afghanistan.",No abstract available

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Afghanistan has been enduring prolonged periods of armed conflict, which have severely affected its infrastructure and healthcare system. The ongoing instability and limited resources have exacerbated public health issues, including the challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research focuses on the intersection of armed conflict and AMR in Afghanistan. It seeks to highlight the vulnerability of conflict-affected populations to antimicrobial-resistant pathogens and address critical human rights challenges related to health and disease management in such settings.

3. **Research Methods Used:**
   The study provides a review and critical appraisal of existing literature and data concerning the status of AMR in Afghanistan. It synthesizes past reports and studies that have investigated the impact of conflict on healthcare services and the proliferation of AMR.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The research identifies that prolonged conflict and poor healthcare infrastructure have led to significant human and economic losses due to antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections in Afghanistan. Frequent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and under-dosaging are major contributing factors. Resource constraints limit the availability of effective antimicrobials, exacerbating the situation.

5. **Examination of the Country's Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   While the article highlights the issues of AMR in Afghanistan, it does not delve deeply into specific legal frameworks or policies. Instead, it emphasizes the overall impact of the conflict and healthcare shortcomings on the problem.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that there is an urgent need for increased efforts to identify major contributors to AMR and to educate the public on its importance. They call for improved strategies to manage antibiotic use and to strengthen healthcare systems, particularly in conflict zones.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**

This summary highlights the interplay between societal challenges and healthcare issues, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to curb AMR in conflict-affected regions like Afghanistan.","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) constitutes a serious impediment to the attainment of the World Health Organization's Sustainable Development Goals, which seek to ensure and promote healthy living among humans and animals. Studies have identified the vulnerability of conflict-affected populations to exposure to antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Resource-limited countries like Afghanistan have suffered for long periods from armed conflicts, and this situation is exacerbated by the already poor or dilapidated healthcare delivery services. The country has suffered human and economic losses due to antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections driven by the prolonged war, as well as a limited number of antimicrobials and frequent under dosage. Most reports point to the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics as the main reason for building up resistant strains. There is a need for more efforts toward identifying the major contributors and enlightening the public on the importance of AMR. This review aimed to provide a critical appraisal regarding the current situation of AMR in Afghanistan."

It is shown that the peaceful transformation of Afghanistan is impeded by such persistent threats as religious extremism, terrorism, illegal drug trafficking. The complex mosaic of regional relations, in which Afghanistan is becoming an important element due to the changes that have happened in this country, is determined in Asia by the growing rivalry and competitive struggle of major economic states of the region, as well as global players, and by the efforts of all of them to build various international coalitions (Shanghai Cooperation Organization, RIC – Russia, India, China; Quadripartite Security Dialogue – QUAD, C5+1, Organization of Turkic States, etc.). Of particular interest in this regard is the position of the neighboring states – the three Central Asian nations (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan), as well as China, Pakistan, India and Iran. Apart from that, this study also outlines the most important challenges for the national security interests of Afghanistan’s Asian neighbors. An optimal scenario for both Afghanistan’s Asian neighbors and Russia would imply achieving a stable consensus in this country. Afghanistan becoming a full member of such an influential international bloc as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, where Russia, Central Asian states and major Asian economic powers are already represented, can have positive consequences for the stabilization of the situation in the country and the whole Asian region. This would create favorable conditions for successful economic and political interaction between the Central and South Asian states. In conclusion the author emphasizes that the transformations in Afghanistan have complicated regional challenges, prompting neighboring states to focus on the military-political component of their security. Aiming to prevent a negative scenario in Afghanistan, they also multiplied diplomatic contacts with the current leadership of the country. The new international political configuration that is emerging in modern Asia dictates new approaches in the security sphere for the Asian states."

   The study employs mathematical modeling, categorizing a population into susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and recovered (R) groups. Researchers focus on fundamental properties like positivity and boundedness and rigorously analyze the model's stability and equilibria. Numerical methods used include Euler, Runge–Kutta, and nonstandard finite difference methods, the latter proving more effective for long-term disease dynamics analysis.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The study finds that traditional numerical methods like Euler and Runge–Kutta are time-dependent and inadequate for long-term simulation of disease dynamics. Conversely, the nonstandard finite difference method performs well without time constraints, offering better insights into the long-term behavior of the epidemic.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks, Institutions, and Policies:**
   N/A (The article does not appear to examine legal frameworks or policies directly related to human rights, focusing instead on the mathematical and computational aspects of modeling the polio epidemic.)

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors conclude that the nonstandard finite difference method provides a more reliable and effective approach for studying polio dynamics over long periods. They suggest that this method can enhance the understanding of the long-term impact of polio in affected regions, aiding in targeted intervention strategies.

7. **Study Limitations:**
   The study's limitations include its focus on mathematical modeling without direct analysis of the social, political, or legal factors that might affect polio eradication efforts. Additionally, while the study does not explicitly address data availability or political climate, these factors inherently limit the precision and applicability of any model in real-world scenarios.",No abstract available

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   Afghanistan, a country facing ongoing political instability and conflict, has struggled with providing consistent and effective healthcare infrastructure. These challenges, compounded by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted the critical need for robust healthcare systems, including sustainable water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The research aimed to evaluate the availability of WASH services and standard precautions in healthcare facilities (HCFs) across seven Afghan provinces before the COVID-19 pandemic, and to correlate these findings with the rates of COVID-19 infections among healthcare workers (HCWs) in these areas.

3. **Research Methods:**
   The study utilized secondary data from the Afghanistan Service Provision Assessment survey conducted in 2018-19, covering 142 public and private HCFs. This was combined with COVID-19 case data from the Afghanistan Ministry of Public Health. Analyses included calculating the prevalence of WASH services and precautions, using ArcGIS for spatial representation, and scatter plots to identify potential correlations with COVID-19 cases.

4. **Main Findings:**
   The study found that although a high percentage of facilities (97% for improved water sources, 94% for improved toilets) existed, the availability of comprehensive hygiene services and standard precautions was inadequate, more so in private facilities. Herat province, which had the highest COVID-19 infection rates among HCWs, also reported poorer WASH services and precautions compared to other provinces.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks:**
   While the study did not specifically dissect legal frameworks, it highlighted systemic gaps in the provision of necessary health protection services in Afghan HCFs, pointing to underlying structural and policy deficiencies.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors concluded that there is a significant disparity in WASH service availability and standard precautions between public and private HCFs. Enhanced pre-pandemic preparation and investment in adequate WASH facilities and precautions are crucial in mitigating the impact of infectious diseases. Policies should aim to prioritize these improvements, particularly in private facilities.

1. **Context**: Hypertension is a significant global health challenge, with rising prevalence in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The World Health Organization (WHO) has included four single-pill combination (SPC) antihypertensive therapies on its essential medicines list (EML) in 2019, aiming to support their widespread adoption in LMICs to combat high blood pressure.

2. **Purpose & Human Rights Questions**: This research explores macro-level facilitators influencing the implementation of SPC therapy for hypertension in the top 30 most populous LMICs. It focuses on access to medications, examining systemic factors that hinder availability, affecting the right to health.

3. **Research Methods**: The study used online searches and direct contacts to assess the presence of SPCs in national markets, national EMLs, and national hypertension treatment guidelines across these countries. Data collection was hierarchical, using searches in databases and official portals, and reaching out to in-country contacts for unavailable information.

4. **Main Findings**: Key findings revealed that only 11 out of 30 LMICs had all national-level facilitators for SPC implementation. Furthermore, although SPCs were available in markets across nearly all countries, only 12 countries listed them in their national EMLs, and several had outdated guidelines without recommendations for SPCs.

5. **Legal Frameworks & Policies**: Many LMICs align their national guidelines with international ones like the WHO’s. However, without inclusion on national EMLs and strong policy frameworks, SPCs remained inaccessible to many. National guidelines were available in 26 out of 30 countries, often recommending SPCs as a second-line or initial treatment option.

6. **Conclusions & Recommendations**: The authors conclude that while international endorsement improves availability, country-level policy adaptations are crucial. Recommendations include updating national EMLs to include SPCs, enhancing treatment guidelines to support SPC adoption, and addressing market and affordability issues.

7. **Limitations**: The study covered only the 30 most populous LMICs, potentially limiting generalizability to all 135 LMICs. Data availability was a challenge, with difficulties in accessing up-to-date national documents, reflecting political and systemic barriers in these regions. The focus on macro-level factors means individual, community, and other systemic barriers were not fully explored.

The study highlights the opportunity and necessity for LMICs to align with international standards and enhance their healthcare systems to ensure wider access to effective hypertension treatments.",No abstract available

It addresses the human rights challenges related to healthcare provision and the safety of blood transfusions, focusing on blood-borne diseases such as Hepatitis B and C, HIV, and syphilis.

3. **Research Methods**: This cross-sectional study used retrospective data collected from 284 blood centers across Afghanistan from 2015-2020. The study involved testing blood samples of donors for serological markers of infection, using rapid screening devices. Data were analyzed using statistical software to determine prevalence rates.

4. **Main Findings**: The study found an overall prevalence of blood-borne infections at 4.36%, with hepatitis B being the most common at 2.95%. Infections were more prevalent in replacement donors (4.88%) than voluntary donors (3.66%). The prevalence was lower compared to some neighboring countries but notably higher than others. The study highlighted a serious deficiency in female blood donations.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies**: The study underscored the lack of blood safety legislation and proper blood donation policies in Afghanistan, posing significant challenges to ensuring safe transfusions.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors concluded that blood safety in Afghanistan is threatened by these infections, stressing the need for a shift towards 100% reliance on voluntary blood donors and the use of highly sensitive screening assays. They call for further research to identify risk factors and guide intervention strategies.

7. **Limitations**: The study faced limitations, including the use of rapid screening without confirmatory tests, insufficient data on donors' socio-demographic factors, and an exclusive focus on male donors due to the absence of female participants.

Introduction
Mapping and population size estimates of people who inject drugs (PWID) provide information needed for monitoring coverage of programs and planning interventions. The objectives of this study were to provide the locations and numbers of PWID in eight cities in Afghanistan and extrapolate estimates for the country as a whole.


Methods
Multiple population size estimation methods were used, including key informant interviews for mapping and enumeration with reverse tracking, unique object and service multipliers, capture-recapture, and wisdom of the crowds. The results of the several methods were synthesized using the Anchored Multiplier–a Bayesian approach to produce point estimates and 95% credible intervals (CI). Using the prevalence of PWID in the eight cities and their correlation with proxy indicators, we extrapolated the PWID population size for all of Afghanistan.


Results
Key informants and field mapping identified 374 hotspots across the eight cities from December 29, 2018 to March 20, 2019. Synthesizing results of the multiple methods, the number of male PWID in the eight study cities was estimated to be 11,506 (95% CI 8,449–15,093), corresponding to 0.69% (95% CI 0.50–0.90) of the adult male population age 15–64 years. The total number of women who injected drugs was estimated at 484 (95% CI 356–633), corresponding to 0.03% (95% CI 0.02–0.04) of the adult female population. Extrapolating by proxy indicators, the total number of PWID in Afghanistan was estimated to be 54,782 (95% CI 40,250–71,837), men and 2,457 (95% CI 1,823–3,210) women. The total number of PWID in Afghanistan was estimated to be 57,207 (95% CI 42,049–75,005), which corresponds to 0.37% (95% CI 0.27–0.48) of the adult population age 15 to 64 years.


Discussion
This study provided estimates for the number of PWID in Afghanistan. These estimates can be used for advocating and planning services for this vulnerable at-risk population.

Afghanistan, a country challenged by war and conflicts, has been in a state of turmoil for several years. The prolonged suffering has brought many challenges to the country’s inhabitants. Among these, food security is one important cause for concern. Food security occurs when people continuously have physical and economic access to adequate, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary requirements and food preferences for a functional and healthy life. Amid the pandemic, Afghanistan has witnessed a large increase in food shortages due to its dependence on neighboring countries. In light of current circumstances, food insecurity, coupled with political instability and the third wave of the COVID-19, have made it extremely hard for people to access daily provisions. Hence, people are left to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic with economic recession and poverty as the backdrop of the other health crises. To mitigate food security, international attempts are the required at this critical juncture. The aim of this article is to understand the causes leading to food insecurity and its implications in Afghanistan and to propose solutions that will improve the overall food security at the policy and implementation levels."

Afghanistan's academics despair months after Taliban takeover,Smriti Mallapaty,https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-03774-y,2021-12-17,[],Note,1,Yes,"['Education', 'Human Rights']","['Higher Education', 'Gender', 'Freedom of Speech']",,"The article discusses the dire situation for academics and researchers in Afghanistan following the Taliban's takeover in August 2021. Historically, Afghanistan has faced instability, which drastically increased with the withdrawal of US-led coalition troops and the subsequent rise of the Taliban. This development has created a challenging environment for academic freedom and scientific research, a challenge exacerbated by the lack of recognition from the broader international community, which has resulted in frozen foreign aid and research funding.

**Research Purpose and Human Rights Challenges:**
The purpose of the article is to spotlight the plummeting state of academic freedom and research in Afghanistan, focusing on human rights issues like the persecution of academics, especially those with international ties or belonging to ethnic minorities. It highlights the restriction of academic freedoms as a form of censorship and the threat to personal safety due to ethnic and gender-based discrimination.

**Research Methods:**
The article primarily relies on interviews and testimonies from Afghan researchers, academics, and international organizations to gather data. It also reviews recent changes in educational policies and international aid dynamics.

**Main Findings:**
The article reveals severe disruptions in Afghanistan's academic sector, marked by halted research activities, a ""brain drain"" of scholars seeking to leave, unpaid salaries, and significant challenges in education, especially after co-education bans. It underscores the replacement of university staff with less qualified individuals aligned with the Taliban and reports mistreatment and violence against academics, especially from minority ethnicities.

**Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
While not detailed extensively, the article reflects on recent policy changes under the Taliban, such as the segregation of education by gender and appointments of biased representatives in universities, indicating a significant departure from previous legal and institutional standards related to education and human rights.

**Conclusions and Recommendations:**
The article concludes that the future for Afghan researchers remains bleak without international support. It suggests the necessity for the international community to devise mechanisms to support scholars at risk and facilitate research independently of the Taliban's oversight. It recommends increased efforts to provide platforms for displaced researchers abroad.

**Study Limitations:**
The article highlights limitations including a volatile political climate, closed embassies hindering escape efforts, and decreased data availability due to disrupted institutional operations. Moreover, the sensitivity of the human rights situation poses risks to those providing information, making it challenging to obtain comprehensive data.

Overall, the situation for researchers in Afghanistan remains precarious, with academic freedoms heavily curtailed under Taliban rule and little hope for short-term improvement.",No abstract available

2. **Purpose and Human Rights Challenges**: The research aims to address the challenges ASRs face in accessing healthcare in the UK, emphasizing the importance of holistic and long-term care beyond short-term, volunteer-driven responses. It specifically focuses on the need to uphold the human rights of these populations in a healthcare setting.

3. **Research Methods**: The article draws on existing data, policy analysis, and public health guidelines to outline best practices for providing care to Afghan refugees. It considers various aspects of care, including communication, cultural responsiveness, and advocacy, to ensure effective engagement with these communities.

4. **Main Findings**: Key findings highlight significant challenges faced by ASRs in accessing primary care, such as language barriers, mental health issues, and cultural considerations. It identifies a high level of mental distress due to both pre- and post-migration stressors. The research underscores that short-term solutions are inadequate for the complex needs of these populations.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies**: Although specific legal frameworks are not deeply explored, the article mentions that everyone in the UK is entitled to free primary care, regardless of immigration status. It advocates for adherence to policies that prevent exclusion based on lack of documentation, promoting the values of 'Safe Surgeries' as endorsed by 'Doctors of the World'.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: The authors conclude that the current situation presents an opportunity to reflect and improve how primary care services support ASRs. Recommendations include enhancing access to healthcare, effectively communicating in patients' preferred languages, engaging with cultural nuances, and managing distress through appropriate mental health support. The authors stress the importance of embedding care, perseverance, time, and advocacy into healthcare provision.

7. **Limitations of the Study**: The study acknowledges limitations related to the UK's political climate, especially in terms of policy implementation and the availability of resources for ASRs. There is also an implicit challenge in addressing the sensitive needs of ASRs within the constraints of the existing healthcare framework, with potential barriers in effectively applying the suggested best practices at scale.",No abstract available
"Refugees’ Agency: On Resistance, Resilience, and Resources","José Renkens, Els Rommes, Maria van den Muijsenbergh",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19020806,2022-1-12,"['Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen', 'Radboud Universiteit', 'Radboud University Medical Center']",Article,1,Yes,"['Healthcare and Public Health', 'Humanitarian and Development Assistance']","['Mental Health', 'Migration']",,"### Summary of the Article:

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   - The article addresses the context of increasing global migration due to war, human rights violations, and persecution. Refuges face numerous challenges, including severe mental health issues exacerbated by stressful pre-flight, transit, and post-settlement experiences. Refugee groups often live under challenging social and financial conditions, making them susceptible to further mental distress.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   - The research aims to contribute to health equality by examining how refugee parents respond to mental distress in themselves and their children. It specifically addresses the challenges refugees face in accessing mental healthcare in the Netherlands due to cultural differences, communication barriers, and a lack of confidence in healthcare services.

3. **Research Methods:**
   - The study employs the concept of agency, adapted from feminist theorization, to explore how refugees manage mental distress. Agency here refers to the capacity for decision-making and taking purposive action. The study refines existing models of agency to include subaltern resilience, which acknowledges diverse, often non-assertive responses to mental health challenges.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - The research identifies that refugees' agency involves recognizing mental distress, setting mental health goals, and taking action, though not always in visibly assertive ways. Agency involves using various resources like social networks and personal resilience to manage stress and mental wellbeing.

5. **Examination of Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   - The article does not provide an in-depth analysis of the Netherlands' legal frameworks but highlights the cultural and systemic barriers within healthcare services that limit refugees' access to care.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - It concludes that a deeper understanding of refugees' agency and the resources they utilize can help healthcare professionals better tailor services to refugees' needs. The study recommends recognizing and leveraging the resources refugees use to build more effective support systems that align with their lived experiences.

7. **Limitations of the Study:**
   - Limitations include the complexity of capturing non-visible forms of agency within a potentially sensitive political climate. There are challenges associated with data availability and the nuanced nature of refugees' experiences in navigating healthcare and expressing mental health needs.","This study set out to answer the question ‘Which kinds of agency do refugees perform when dealing with mental health problems of themselves and their children?’. Aiming to gain more insight in why it seems harder for refugee parents and minors than for the native population to talk to health professionals about their mental health and wellbeing, we combined two theoretical notions of agency to investigate a broad spectrum of informants’ behaviour. We conducted 25 interviews with 30 refugees from 8 countries (Syria, Yemen, Iran, Afghanistan, Armenia, Eritrea, Turkish Kurdistan, Vietnam), whose Dutch residence permit varied from 26 years to less than one year. Data were analysed through open and axial coding, followed by pattern analyses. Although sometimes refugees seek (mental) healthcare, at other times they show agency by doing ‘nothing’ or by deliberately using distracting activities to deal with severe stress. Making use of resources available to them, oftentimes refugees show agency in ways that are less visible to healthcare professionals, by surviving, showing resilience, and suffering. In these cases, we think healthcare for refugees should intervene in a non-medical way, e.g., by supporting them to obtain resources that help refugees to (re)gain agency."

1. **Historical, Political, or Social Context:**
   The study is set against the backdrop of the global refugee crisis. In 2020, the UNHCR noted over 80 million forcibly displaced people, with 26.3 million as refugees. These individuals often experience heightened mental health risks due to experiences of war, violence, and oppression. The 1951 Refugee Convention outlines the challenges faced by refugees, including persecution fears preventing safe return to their home countries.

2. **Purpose of the Research:**
   The study aims to identify the mental health issues present among recently resettled refugees, focusing on which subgroups are disproportionately diagnosed with psychiatric conditions and investigating associations between mental health service attendance and factors like gender, age, arrival route, and region of origin.

3. **Research Methods:**
   This cross-sectional study was conducted in Aarhus, Denmark, including refugees aged 18 and older who accepted a health assessment offer from 2014 to 2020. Data were sourced from health assessments and psychiatric diagnoses, categorized by demographic factors and analyzed using statistical methods like logistic regression.

4. **Main Findings:**
   - Refugees have higher rates of mental health disorders compared to native populations.
   - Systematic screening can effectively identify and facilitate treatment for mental health issues.
   - PTSD was the most common diagnosis, with higher prevalence among refugees from Southern and Western Asia and lower prevalence among those from Eastern Africa.
   - Older refugees are at an increased risk for PTSD symptoms and diagnosis but are also more likely to miss treatment.
   
5. **Legal Frameworks and Policies:**
   Denmark provides universal healthcare, which is theoretically accessible to refugees upon receiving a residence permit. Legislation covering interpreter expenses poses barriers to mental healthcare access after three years of residency.

6. **Authors' Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   The authors highlight the necessity of systematic health screenings, including mental health, for timely diagnosis and treatment in newly arrived refugees. Such screenings are critical to identify mental health issues early and should be mandatory during resettlement to support integration and well-being.

7. **Limitations:**
   Limitations include potential biases due to missing data on some participants, and the political climate possibly affecting the availability and quality of data. Aarhus's systematic health assessments may not be representative of other regions, limiting the study's generalizability. Some cultural factors influencing mental health perceptions remain unexplored.","(1) Background: Recognizing mental health problems in newly arrived refugees poses a challenge. Little is known of the mental health profile of refugees currently arriving in Northern Europe. (2) Method: In total, we included 900 adult (≥18 years old) refugees arriving in Aarhus, Denmark, between 1 January 2014 and 1 January 2020. All participants accepted an offer of a voluntary systematic health assessment from the municipality in Aarhus, including a mental health screening. (3) Results: Within this cohort, 26% (237/900) of the participants were referred to the Department of Psychiatry, Aarhus University Hospital, 24% (212/900) were in contact with the department and 21% (185/900) received ≥1 psychiatric diagnosis. Within the subpopulation referred (n = 237), 64% (152/237) were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (DF431), 14% (34/237) with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (F40–F48) and 13% (30/237) with major mood disorders (F30–F39). Among the participants referred to the Department of Psychiatry and participants receiving a diagnosis, we found an overrepresentation of participants originating from the Southern Asian region (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran) and with an age above 44 years. (4) Conclusion: We found a high prevalence of both referrals and psychiatric diagnoses in newly arrived refugees. Attention to psychiatric conditions in refugees and systematic health assessments during resettlement are needed."

Concurrently, scholarly research has given rise to a number of articles, white papers, and books on humanitarian insecurity. Most of this work centres on external threats, neglecting the internal mechanisms that humanitarian organisations use to mitigate security situations. This paper builds on the existing literature by focusing on the decision‐making processes of humanitarian organisations, drawing on data collected from 16 security managers or advisers. The findings reveal that several factors contribute to contextual uncertainty and complexity, including recipient perceptions, local government actions, the behaviour of other non‐governmental organisations (NGOs) in the area, logistical issues, risk variance within a single location, and organisational mandate. Furthermore, the results indicate that NGOs utilise a combination of decision‐making processes to determine how to manage security in high‐risk environments."
